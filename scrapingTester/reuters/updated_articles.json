        "content": "April 18 (Reuters) - Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O)   is set to receive $6.1 billion in grants from the U.S. Commerce Department to help pay for domestic chip factory projects, Democratic U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Thursday. The award, which is not yet finalized, will fund chipmaking facilities in New York and Idaho from the CHIPS & Science law, the New York senator said in a statement. \u201cThis monumental and historic federal investment will power and propel Micron to bring its transformative $100+ billion four-fab project in central New York to life, creating an estimated 50,000 jobs,\u201d he said. Micron plans to build a complex of chip plants in New York over the next 20 years, the senator added. The news caps off a string of Chips Act grants announced by the Biden administration in recent weeks as the United States seeks to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan and supercharge its own lagging chip production. The U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). Lawmakers have warned that U.S. dependence on chips manufactured in Taiwan by the world's top contract chip manufacturer, TSMC (2330.TW)  , is risky because China claims the self-governed island as its territory and has reserved the right to use force to retake it. Intel won $8.5 billion in grants last month while Taiwan's TSMC clinched $6.6 billion in April to build out its American production. Samsung followed this week with a $6.4 billion award to boost production in Texas. The historic Chips Act allocates $52.6 billion to support the sector. The Commerce Department is dedicating $28 billion for government subsidies for advanced chips manufacturing - although it has more than $70 billion in requests - and also has $75 billion in lending authority. New York Governor Kathy Hochul said in a statement that the largest private investment in American history is on its way to Central New York."

        "content": "AMSTERDAM, April 18 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O)   said on Thursday it had become the first company to assemble one of Dutch tech group ASML's new \"High NA EUV\" lithography tools, an important part of the U.S. computer chip maker's drive to outshine rivals. Intel was the first company to buy one of the 350 million euro ($373 million) machines made by top chip equipment supplier ASML (ASML.AS)  . The tools are expected to lead to new generations of smaller, faster chips, though there are financial and engineering risks involved. \"We agreed to the pricing when we committed to the tools and we would not have done that if we were not confident there were cost-effective uses for it,\" Intel's director of lithography Mark Phillips said in a briefing with journalists. ASML, Europe's largest tech firm, dominates the market for lithography systems, machines that use beams of light to help create the circuitry of chips. Lithography is one of many technologies chipmakers use to improve chips, but it is a limiting factor in how small the features on a chip can be - smaller means faster and more energy efficient. The High NA tools are expected to help shrink chip designs by up to two thirds, but chipmakers must weigh that benefit against a higher cost and whether older tech may be more reliable and good enough. Intel's determination to be the first to adopt High NA is not accidental. It helped develop EUV technology - named for the \"extreme ultraviolet\" light wavelengths it uses. But it began using ASML's first EUV product later than Taiwanese rival TSMC (2330.TW)  , which CEO Pat Gelsinger has acknowledged was a big mistake. Instead, Intel focused on techniques known as \"multi-patterning\" - essentially going through more steps with lower resolution lithography machines to achieve an equivalent effect. \"That's when we got in trouble,\" Phillips said. Although the older DUV tools were cheaper, complex multi-patterning became too time consuming and led to too many faulty chips, slowing Intel's commercial progress. The U.S. company has now adopted first generation EUV for the most crucial parts of its best chips, and Phillips said it expects the move to High NA EUV will be smoother. \"Now that we have EUV we're looking forward, we don't want to get in the same boat where we have to push (ASML's first generation EUV machines) too far,\" he said. Phillips said the machine at its Hillsboro, Oregon, campus would be \"fully up and running later this year\". Intel plans to use the machine, which is the size of a double decker bus, in the development of its 14A generation of chips in 2025, with early production expected in 2026 and full commercial production in 2027. ASML said alongside earnings this week it had begun the process of shipping a second High NA system to an unidentified customer, likely TSMC or South Korea's Samsung (005930.KS)  . Shipping and installation of the massive tools may take up to six months, giving Intel a head start. ($1 = 0.9381 euros)"

The jury determined that Samsung owes lump sums of $61 million for infringing one G+ patent and $81 million for another, according to the verdict form  . The three-day retrial on damages followed Chief U.S. District Judge Rodney Gilstrap's order to throw out an earlier $67.5 million verdict for G+ in the same case. G+ attorney Jennifer Truelove of McKool Smith said in a statement that the company was \"very pleased\" with the verdict. Representatives for Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. Plano, Texas-based G+ owns patents covering technology that international standards organizations have deemed essential for devices to comply with 5G wireless standards. It sued Samsung in 2022, alleging that the Korean tech giant included its technology in 5G-capable Galaxy smartphones without a license. Samsung denied the allegations, argued that the patents were invalid and said that G+ failed to offer licenses on fair and reasonable terms as standards organizations require. A jury said in January that Samsung infringed two of the three patents at issue and should pay $67.5 million in damages. Gilstrap in March ordered a new trial to redetermine the appropriate amount of damages, after finding that the jury may have been confused about whether the award should be a lump sum or running royalty. The case is G+ Communications LLC v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, No. 2:22-cv-00078.

The Southeast Asian country\u2019s central bank has provided an \u201cunprecedented\u201d $24 billion of \u201cspecial loans\u201d to Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between October 2022 and the start of this month, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing documents and a source. At around 5.6% of GDP, that\u2019s not far off the outlay major governments on average spent rescuing lenders during the global financial crisis. The fallout from the latest lifeline will ripple through boardrooms around the world. Authorities appear to have struggled to stem a run on SCB despite taking it under its supervision 18 months ago. Often such direct intervention is enough to restore confidence in emerging and frontier markets. Not here in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, whose government has set a 6%-6.5% growth target for this year. It is a wake-up call for those who looked past recent anti-corruption rumblings in the manufacturing dynamo or who thought their investments might benefit if officials cracked the cosy nexus between large conglomerates and the state. The communist regime\u2019s \u201cblazing furnace\u201d campaign has sparked a real estate crisis, and heads are rolling; Truong My Lan - the tycoon behind SCB - was on Thursday sentenced to death for her role in allegedly siphoning $12.5 billion from SCB, while effectively controlling it through proxies. The country has also changed presidents twice in just over a year. The upshot? Vietnam looks increasingly unstable just as its importance in supply chains rises. It accounts for an estimated half of smartphone production for South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  . Since 2019, Apple (AAPL.O)   has spent   $16 billion in the country through its suppliers and its boss, Tim Cook, was in Hanoi this week pledging more. Overall foreign direct investment grew   to $37 billion in 2023, up 32% from the previous year, even though global FDI shrunk. Financial sponsors including U.S. private equity firm KKR (KKR.N)   have placed large bets, too. There is no known disruption so far to global investments in the country, but the enormous bank rescue suggests Vietnam\u2019s anti-corruption push could produce more unexpected consequences. Global companies determined to tap cheap labour will need nerves of steel. Follow @anshumandaga   on X (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.) CONTEXT NEWS Vietnam has mounted an \"unprecedented\" rescue of Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank (SCB), a lender engulfed in the nation\u2019s biggest financial fraud, Reuters reported on April 17 citing three bank documents and new information from other sources. The central bank had provided SCB, previously one of the country's largest commercial lenders by deposits, with 593 trillion dong ($24 billion) in \"special loans\" as of April 2, according to a recent update produced by the bank on the matter, seen by Reuters. The State Bank of Vietnam's previously unreported cash injections into SCB amount to 5.6% of the nation's annual economic output, or about one-fourth of Vietnam's foreign-exchange reserves. The central bank placed SCB under its supervision to stem a run on the bank sparked by the October 2022 arrest of real estate tycoon Truong My Lan. She was sentenced to death on April 11."

        "content": "April 17 - The Cleveland Guardians are getting comfortable with life on the road, which resumes Wednesday when they face the Boston Red Sox in the third game of a four-game series. After winning the series opener 6-0 on Monday, Cleveland improved its road record to 9-2 this season by beating Boston 10-7 in 11 innings Tuesday. \"It's a testament to these guys,\" Cleveland manager Stephen Vogt said. \"That first road trip was long. Coming out of spring training, being on the road for 10 games and then to come into a tough place to win. It's really hard to win here in Fenway.\" Cleveland surrendered a 5-1 lead Tuesday, but forced extra innings by scoring a run off Boston closer Kenley Jansen in the ninth. The Guardians have won three in a row overall, and two of the victories came in extra innings. \"This group of guys doesn't quit,\" Vogt said. \"They keep fighting. They believe in each other, they root for each other. We got something special brewing right now and the guys feel it.\" Injuries continue to pile up for the Red Sox. Outfielder Tyler O'Neill wasn't in the lineup Tuesday, one day after he collided with third baseman Rafael Devers and required eight stitches to close a cut in his forehead. Devers' two-run double gave Boston a 6-5 lead after six innings Tuesday, but he left the game after the seventh inning with discomfort in his left knee. \"With Raffy we're discussing if we're going to take imaging just to make sure everything is OK,\" Boston manager Alex Cora said following Tuesday's loss. \"It came out of nowhere. There was a play he made in the seventh. He was kind of playing in the mini-shift and he kind of felt it there. We'll know more (Wednesday).\" In addition, Boston starting pitcher Garrett Whitlock left the game after four innings with oblique tightness. Whitlock allowed two runs on three hits, struck out one and walked one. \"They just felt like a precautionary move was to pull me out,\" Whitlock said. \"I just felt a little something in the third inning, but that was it.\" The Guardians are expected to start right-hander Ben Lively on Wednesday. Lively began the season on the 15-day injured list with a viral illness. He made two starts for Triple-A Columbus, but he hasn't not pitched in the majors this season. Cleveland signed Lively last December. He spent the 2023 season with Cincinnati after a three-year stretch with the Samsung Lions of the Korea Baseball Organization. He's 1-0 with a 2.13 ERA in two career appearances (12 1/3 innings) against Boston. Right-hander Tanner Houck (2-1, 2.04 ERA) is listed as Boston's probable starter. Houck has 19 strikeouts against two walks in 17 2/3 innings this season. Houck is 0-1 with one save and a 3.52 ERA in seven career appearances (two starts) against Cleveland. Tuesday's loss dropped Boston's home record to 2-6. The Red Sox are 1-3 in extra-inning games. \"We still have two games in this homestand,\" Cora said. \"It's been a tough one so far, but we come here, win two games and get ready for Pittsburgh.\" --Field Level Media"

ASML, which shipped one High NA tool to Intel (INTC.O)   in December-January, did not identify the second customer. Potential customers could include contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW)  , which makes chips for Nvidia and Apple, or Samsung (005930.KS)  . These machines cost around 350 million euros ($370 million) each and are expected to enable new generations of smaller, faster chips. The sale was disclosed along with ASML's first-quarter earnings that missed expectations TSMC and Samsung have previously said they plan to adopt the new system, which is expected to lead to a major increase in the number of transistors that can be packed onto a single chip. Intel has said it will begin using High NA tools in early production in 2026-2027 with its 14A series chips. The very first High NA machine was assembled at ASML's headquarters in Veldhoven Netherlands, where companies that are adopting EUV technology are being given access to it for testing purposes. The company said it has orders for between 10 and 20 of the machines. Lithography systems use beams of light to help to create the chip circuitry. ASML's first generation of EUV systems, currently used to make most chips in smartphones and AI chips, use light in the \"extreme ultraviolet\" wavelength to create design features down to 13 nanometres in resolution, smaller than a virus. The company said in a post and photo published on X on Wednesday that the High NA machine has successfully produced features at 10 nanometres. The theoretical limit of the machine is 8 nanometres, according to ASML's website. ($1 = 0.9394 euros)"

These chips are expected to be available in platforms from HP (HPQ.N)   and Lenovo (0992.HK)   starting in the second quarter of 2024, AMD said in a press release. AI-enabled PCs are capable of running large-language models and apps powered by the technology directly on the device, instead of the cloud. AMD said its latest Ryzen PRO 8040 Series was built for \"business laptops and mobile workstations\" while its AMD Ryzen PRO 8000 Series was a desktop processor for business users. Its shares were up more than 2% in early trading. Experts have pinned a possible recovery in the PC market on the introduction of AI PCs, as consumers look to upgrade their systems with the new capabilities. The advent of generative AI technology has led to towering demand for advanced semiconductors that can be used to develop and run complex AI programs. In the market for AI PCs, AMD faces intense competition from Intel (INTC.O)   and AI chip front-runner Nvidia (NVDA.O)  , hailed as a leader for graphics processing units (GPUs). AMD introduced   the Ryzen 8000G Series of desktop chips in January, targeted towards the heavy workloads that come along with AI-based tasks. On the same day, Nvidia unveiled its own AI PC chips - the \"GeForce RTX SUPER\" desktop GPUs - saying Acer, ASUS, Dell Technologies (DELL.N)  , HP, Lenovo, and Samsung (005930.KS)   will release AI laptops featuring its technology. Intel also said in January it expects to \"ship approximately 40 million AI PCs in 2024 alone\"."

        "content": "April 16 (Reuters) - America\u2019s small and mid-sized manufacturers may be warming up to the Biden administration\u2019s push for an aggressive industrial policy. In a survey of 150 producers, nearly 49% said they thought President Joe Biden \"is more likely to bring about an American manufacturing renaissance,\" while just over 31% gave that accolade to Republican candidate Donald Trump. About 15% favor an unnamed third-party candidate to revitalize the sector, according to the survey conducted by polling company John Zogby Strategies on behalf of Xometry, a Maryland-based company that provides digital sourcing services for industrial producers. Biden\u2019s industrial policy, headlined by legislation passed in 2022 that sparked a surge of factory construction, is aimed at boosting semiconductors, electric vehicles and green technologies, as well as other sectors. The efforts so far have not produced many manufacturing jobs. And so, as the presidential campaign shifts into higher gear ahead of November\u2019s election, Biden is touring factories to tout his accomplishments, especially to voters in battleground states. \"This is the first time in a long time that we\u2019ve had a deliberate industrial strategy being pushed by the executive branch - that\u2019s unique,\" said Randy Altschuler, chief executive of Xometry. Altschuler said federal investments have yet to filter down to smaller producers, with many of the most high-profile projects favoring giants like Intel and Samsung, which are both planning new semiconductor plants. \"You\u2019re going to see a bigger benefit (for smaller companies) further down the road,\" said Altschuler, as those projects create demand for the underlying pipeline of goods and services needed to complete and supply those factories. Altschuler, who ran for Congress in New York in 2010 and lost and remains a registered Republican, said the political divide over industrial policy - which was once opposed by many Republicans as picking winners and losers - has narrowed sharply in recent years. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, for instance, recently penned an essay for the conservative policy journal National Affairs that argued the U.S. needs a strong industrial policy while faulting the Biden initiatives. Still, manufacturers favor Republicans by one key measure. The National Association of Manufacturers Political Action Committee has so far directed nearly three-quarters of its contributions to Republican candidates in this election cycle, according to the nonprofit research group OpenSecrets."

The funding from the 2022 Chips and Science Act will support two chip production facilities, a research center and a packaging facility, in Taylor, Texas, the agency said, as previously reported by Reuters. It will also enable Samsung to expand its Austin, Texas, semiconductor facility, Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo added, while boosting chip output for the aerospace, defense and auto industries and bolstering national security, administration officials told reporters. \"(These investments) will allow the U.S. to once again lead the world, not just in semiconductor design, which is where we do now lead, but also in manufacturing, advanced packaging, and research and development,\" Raimondo said. Samsung Electronics Co-CEO Kyung Kye Hyun said: \"To meet the expected surge in demand from U.S. customers, for future products like AI chips, our fabs will be equipped for cutting-edge process technologies and help bring security to the U.S. semiconductor supply chain.\" Samsung said it expects to begin production in 2026. Analysts have estimated Samsung is likely to begin making 4-nanometer chips at its pilot production line and eventually expand to 2-nanometer chips. The announcement, which made Samsung the third-largest Chips Act award recipient, as first reported by Reuters, is the latest move by the Biden administration to build out the chipmaking industry in the United States. The goal is to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan, as the U.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity has fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). Lawmakers have warned that U.S. dependence on chips manufactured in Taiwan by the world's top contract chip manufacturer, TSMC (2330.TW), is risky because China claims the self-governed island as its territory and has reserved the right to use force to retake it. \u201cBy investing in leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing, we are helping secure this vulnerable supply chain, boosting our national security and global competitiveness, and creating new jobs for Texans,\u201d said John Cornyn, a Republican U.S. senator from Texas who cosponsored the original legislation. Samsung is expected to invest roughly $45 billion in building and expanding its Texas facilities through the end of the decade, said senior administration officials. \"We applaud Samsung for investing boldly in U.S.-based manufacturing and salute the U.S. Commerce Department for making significant headway in implementing the CHIPS Act\u2019s manufacturing incentives and R&D programs,\" SIA said in a statement. Intel won $8.5 billion in grants last month while Taiwan's TSMC clinched $6.6 billion in April to build out its American production."

Vietnam is already a key manufacturing hub for Apple and Cook was speaking while meeting Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, state media reported. Vietnam will set up a working group to support Apple's investment, Chinh told Cook during the meeting, according to state media. \"Today, Apple announced it will increase spending on suppliers in Vietnam, along with new progress in an initiative to support clean water for local schools,\" the company said in a statement released on Monday on its website. Its spending has already reached some 400 trillion dong ($15.84 billion) and has created some 200,000 jobs, the statement added. Apple did not respond to a request for additional comments about its spending. Cook arrived in Hanoi on Monday for the two-day visit during which he met suppliers, students, content creators and users of Apple products. Apple manufactures iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in Vietnam and suppliers for MacBooks are also investing in the Southeast Asian country. The company had 25 suppliers in Vietnam as of 2022, according to its latest suppliers list, the same as in the previous year and up from 21 in 2020. These suppliers include Foxconn, GoerTek, Luxshare, Intel, Samsung Electronics and Compal. Suppliers to its main vendors, such as Foxconn, are also moving or planning to move to Vietnam, and some are shifting some activities out of China, amid U.S.-China tensions, according to several industry sources who declined to name the companies as the moves were still confidential. While meeting Cook, Chinh said that Vietnam was seeking support from Apple to develop renewable energy as well as in high-quality human resource training, VTV said in a report. Apple's latest announcement came days after activists urged the company to take action on Vietnam's detention of climate experts. ($1 = 25,260 dong)"

        "content": "TAIPEI, April 16 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)  , , the dominant producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is expected to report a 5% rise in first-quarter profit on Thursday thanks to strong demand. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O)   and Nvidia (NVDA.O)  , has benefited from a surge towards AI that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand and pushed TSMC's stock to a record high. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$217.2 billion ($6.71 billion) for the quarter ended March 31, according to an LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 22 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That compares to the first-quarter net profit of T$206.9 billion last year. TSMC last week reported a 16.5% rise in first-quarter revenue, beating market expectations and at the high end of the company's own guidance. Eric Yao, a vice president at Taiwan's Eastspring Investments, which manages about T$90 billion of client assets in Taiwanese stocks, said the $6.6 billion in U.S. subsidies for TSMC's new Arizona plants augured well for its prospects of maintaining its lead in advanced process technologies. \"TSMC will likely continue to lead in that front, and Intel (INTC.O)   and Samsung (005930.KS)   will not have much chance to catch up,\" he said, referring to two rivals who want to challenge the company's dominance. Intel this month disclosed deepening operating losses for its foundry business, a blow to the chipmaker as it tries to regain a technology lead it lost in recent years to TSMC, which also announced last week it would build a third fab in Arizona. Fubon Securities analysts said they expected TSMC to revise up its outlook for AI demand for future years. \"TSMC previously indicated that AI could account for high-teens of its revenue by 2026, but based on our calculation, we think the target could be reached earlier in 2025.\" The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock having surged 36% so far this year to a historic high, compared with a 14% gain for the broader market (.TWII)  . TSMC is due to hold an earnings call at 0600 GMT on Thursday. ($1 = 32.3890 Taiwan dollars)"

        "content": "April 14 (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL.O) smartphone shipments dropped about 10% in the first quarter of 2024, hurt by intensifying competition by Android smartphone makers aiming for the top spot, data from research firm IDC showed on Sunday. Global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% to 289.4 million units during January-March, with Samsung (005930.KS), at 20.8% market share, clinching the top phonemaker spot from Apple. The iPhone-maker's steep sales decline comes after its strong performance in the December quarter when it overtook Samsung as the world's No.1 phone maker. It's back to the second spot, with 17.3% market share, as Chinese brands such as Huawei gain market share. Xiaomi, one of China's top smartphone makers, occupied the third position with a market share of 14.1% during the first quarter. South Korea's Samsung, which launched its latest flagship smartphone lineup - Galaxy S24 series - in the beginning of the year, shipped more than 60 million phones during the period. Global sales of Galaxy S24 smartphones jumped 8%, compared to last year's Galaxy S23 series during their first three weeks of availability, data provider Counterpoint previously said. In the first quarter, Apple shipped 50.1 million iPhones, down from 55.4 million units it shipped same period last year, according to IDC. Apple's smartphone shipments in China shrank 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023 from a year earlier. The drop underscores the challenges facing the U.S. firm in its third biggest market, as some Chinese companies and government agencies limit employees' use of Apple devices, a measure that mirrors U.S. government restrictions on Chinese apps on security grounds. The Cupertino, California-based company in June will hold its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where it will highlight updates to the software powering iPhones, iPads, and other Apple devices. Investors are closely watching for updates on artificial intelligence development at Apple, which has so far spoken little about incorporating the AI technology into its devices. The company earlier this year lost the crown as the world's most valuable company to Microsoft (MSFT.O)."

Mason Capital had claimed $200 million in its case with the Netherlands-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), but its argument was only partly accepted. Mason Capital argued that its investors suffered damage as a result of government influence over the decision of South Korea's largest pension fund, the National Pension Service (NPS), to approve the $8 billion merger of Samsung affiliates Samsung C&T (028260.KS) and Cheil Industries in 2015. Last year, the PCA ordered the South Korean government to pay U.S. hedge fund Elliott about $108.5 million in a case stemming from the same merger. In the Mason Capital case, the PCA ordered the South Korean government to pay Mason Capital about $11 million in fees and interest in addition to the $32 million award, the justice ministry said. The ministry said it would \"issue its analysis of the ruling and future plan\" later. Mason Capital did not have an immediate comment."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, April 8 (Reuters) - The Biden administration plans to announce it is awarding more than $6 billion to South Korea's Samsung (005930.KS) next week to expand its chip output in Taylor, Texas, as it seeks to ramp up chipmaking in the U.S., two people familiar with the matter said. The subsidy, which will be unveiled by Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo, will go toward construction of four facilities in Taylor, including one $17 billion chipmaking plant that Samsung announced in 2021, another factory, an advanced packaging facility and a research and development center, one of the sources said. It will also include an investment in another undisclosed location, the source said, adding that Samsung will more than double its U.S. investment to over $44 billion as part of the deal. The Commerce Department and Samsung declined to comment. Texas Governor Greg Abbott's office did not respond to requests for comment. One of the sources said it would be the third largest of the program, just behind Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), which was awarded $6.6 billion on Monday and agreed to expand its investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona factory by 2030. The announcement will cap off a string of major Chips and Science grants in quick succession as the U.S. seeks to expand domestic chip production and lure away capital that might have been used to build plants in China and the region. Congress in 2022 approved the Chips and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in research and manufacturing subsidies. Lawmakers also approved $75 billion in government loan authority, but one of the sources said Samsung plans to take no loans. The CHIPS Act's goal is to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan, as the share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. has fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. U.S. President Joe Biden will not attend the event, the two people said. He faces a tough fight to win a second term in November against former President and Republican rival Donald Trump. Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas was invited to attend, one of the people added. While both TSMC and Intel (INTC.O), which was awarded $8.5 billion to expand its U.S. chip output last month, will expand production in the key swing state of Arizona, Samsung' expansion in reliably Republican Texas is seen as less likely to help Biden at the polls."

While inflation moderated to 3.1% in March from a peak of 6.3% in July 2022 it was still higher than the central bank's 2% target, suggesting a cut to interest rates was not imminent. All 39 economists in the April 3-8 Reuters poll expected the BOK to leave the base rate (KROCRT=ECI) unchanged at 3.50% on April 12. A strong 86% majority of economists, 31 of 36, expected rates to remain at the current level until at least end-June. \"The monetary policy board is expected to freeze the base interest rate. It is expected to be a unanimous decision, while market participants are also keen to see whether there will be more board members arguing for the need for interest rate cuts,\" said Ji-man Kim, an economist at Samsung Securities in Seoul. \"More countries starting to discuss interest rate cuts may have an impact on domestic monetary policy.\" The central bank will probably not cut interest rates this year despite growth momentum not being robust as the battle against inflation was far from over, former Deputy Governor Lee Seung-heon told Reuters in an interview on Monday. However, median poll forecasts showed the BOK cutting rates by 25 basis points in Q3 and Q4, ending the year at 3.00%. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will cut rates by 75 basis points in 2024, according to market expectations. \"There are signs policymakers are becoming more concerned by the economic outlook. While exports have picked up in recent months, domestic demand has been much weaker, with consumer spending struggling badly,\" said Shivaan Tandon, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics. \"The BOK is also keeping an eye on interest rate differentials...by July \u2013 particularly if we're right that the U.S. Fed will have begun its easing cycle by then \u2013 we think the BOK will be ready to move.\" (For other stories from the Reuters global economic poll: nL5N3GE2QG)"

        "content": "April 9 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets. Consumer confidence surveys from Japan and Australia and Taiwan's latest inflation print top the Asia-Pacific calendar on Tuesday, with risk appetite more broadly managing to hold up in the face of U.S. Treasury yields breaking out to new 2024 highs. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Monday rose to 4.464%, the highest since November, yet Wall Street avoided losses and the three major indices ended the day flat. Benchmark Asian, emerging market and world equity indices all made modest gains on Monday too despite the rise in global yields. The 10-year U.S. yield is up 11 bps since Friday's U.S. jobs report, yet equity markets have held the line. It is yet further evidence that investors may be getting used to higher yields and the ever-decreasing amount of rate cuts the Fed is seen delivering this year. A June rate cut is now only a 50-50 probability, and barely 60 bps of easing is expected this year, futures markets show. Figures on Tuesday are expected to show that annual inflation in Taiwan cooled last month to 2.51% from 3.08% in February. This would mark a notable cooling, but inflation would still be comfortably above the central bank's 2% target. The rise in February of almost 1.3 percentage points was the biggest in three years. Taiwan's central bank followed that with a surprise interest rate rise last month. Shares in Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, meanwhile, could get a boost on Tuesday after the U.S. Commerce Department said it would award the firm's U.S. unit a $6.6 billion subsidy for advanced semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona, and up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans. The same goes for shares in Samsung. The Biden administration plans to award $6-7 billion to the South Korean tech giant as it seeks to ramp up chipmaking in the U.S., two people familiar with the matter said. Chinese stocks, meanwhile, have bucked the wider trend. They started the week with a third consecutive daily decline, with the troubled property sector once again front and center of investors' concerns. Developer Shimao Group said on Monday that China Construction Bank (Asia) had filed a liquidation petition against it in Hong Kong over unpaid debts, a rare case of a state-owned bank taking such legal action. The petition centers on Shimao's failure to repay loans of just over $200 million, and contrasts with legal processes against rival firms China Evergrande Group and Country Garden for defaulting on their debts that were launched by overseas-based creditors. China's currency remains under scrutiny too. The onshore yuan is around its weakest level in five months and close to the upper limit of the central bank's daily trading band, while the offshore yuan is still trading above the band's 'ceiling'. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: - Taiwan inflation (March) - Japan consumer confidence (March) - Australia consumer confidence (April)"

        "content": "WASHINGTON, April 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday it would award Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) (2330.TW)   U.S. unit a $6.6 billion subsidy for advanced semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona and up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans. TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona fab by 2030, Commerce said in announcing the preliminary award. The Taiwanese company will produce the world's most advanced 2 nanometer technology at its second Arizona fab expected to begin production in 2028, the department said. \"These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence, and they are the chips that are necessary components for the technologies that we need to underpin our economy, but frankly, a 21st century military and national security apparatus,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple (AAPL.O)   and Nvidia (NVDA.O)  , had previously announced plans to invest $40 billion in Arizona. TSMC expects to begin high-volume production in its first U.S. fab there by the first half of 2025, Commerce said. The $65 billion-plus investment by TSMC is the largest foreign direct investment in a completely new project in U.S. history, the department said. Congress in 2022 approved the Chips and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in research and manufacturing subsidies. Lawmakers also approved $75 billion in government loan authority. TSMC Arizona has also committed to support the development of advanced packaging capabilities through partners in the U.S. to allow customers to purchase advanced chips that are made entirely on U.S. soil, the department said, adding 70% of TSMC customers were U.S. companies. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said the company would help U.S. tech firms \"unleash their innovations by increasing capacity for leading-edge technology through TSMC Arizona.\" Commerce expects the projects will create 6,000 direct manufacturing jobs and 20,000 construction jobs. The department said 14 direct TSMC suppliers plan to construct or expand U.S. plants. At full capacity, TSMC's three fabs in Arizona will manufacture tens of millions of leading-edge chips in 5G/6G smartphones, autonomous vehicles, and AI data center servers, the department said. Through its Arizona fabs, TSMC will support key customers like Apple, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O)   and Qualcomm (QCOM.O)   \"by addressing their leading-edge capacity demand, mitigating supply chain concerns, and enabling them to compete effectively in the ongoing digital transformation era,\" the department added. TSMC said in a separate statement that its Arizona factories aim to achieve a 90% water recycling rate, adding that the company has started the design phase of building a water reclamation plant with a goal of achieving \"near zero liquid discharge\". Commerce last month announced $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans for Intel (INTC.O)   to subsidize leading-edge chip production from the same program. The department is expected to unveil an award for South Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   as soon as next week, sources said. Commerce declined to comment. Samsung did not respond immediately to a request for comment."

        "content": "May 7 (Reuters) - Datadog (DDOG.O)   President Amit Agarwal will step down by the end of 2024 and join the company's board of directors, the cybersecurity firm said on Tuesday, sending its shares down nearly 9% in early trading. Before joining Datadog in 2012, Agarwal held project management roles in Quest Software, now Dell, as well as IBM. The company also forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, anticipating a surge in demand for its cybersecurity solutions in the wake of rising cyber threats. Growing online threats, ransomware attacks and hacking have fueled demand for artificial intelligence-infused cybersecurity solutions. Businesses migrating their workloads to the cloud have also driven usage growth for Datadog, which counts Peloton (PTON.O)   and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   among its more than 3,000 customers. The company handles cloud migration and provides cloud security management services. It forecast second-quarter revenue in the range of $620 million to $624 million, with the mid-point above analysts' estimates of $620.6 million, according to LSEG data. The company expects a second-quarter adjusted profit of between 34 and 36 cents per share. Analysts were estimating an adjusted profit of 35 cents. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31 stood at $611 million, compared with expectations of $591.3 million."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - Google and the U.S. Justice Department wrapped up closing arguments on Friday over claims that the Alphabet (GOOGL.O)   unit has unlawfully dominated web search and related advertising, in a case the government contends could shape the \u201cfuture of the internet.\u201d U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington for hours grilled both sides with questions, probing whether competitive platforms such as ByteDance\u2019s TikTok and Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram are competitive substitutes for search advertising dollars. Mehta said a central issue was platform \u201csubstitute-ability\u201d for advertisers, which the court must resolve. He will now begin preparing to render a major decision on whether Google's conduct broke civil antitrust law. He did not indicate when he would rule, but experts say he could potentially order changes to Google's business practices. Mehta also questioned whether Google assesses competitors\u2019 pricing before making its own adjustments. Google's advertising business is responsible for about three quarters of its revenue. U.S. government lawyer David Dahlquist argued that \u201cadvertising revenue is what drives Google\u2019s monopoly power today.\u201d Google has boasted it feels no real market pressures, Dahlquist said, arguing that the company does not fear increasing its pricing or not improving its products. \u201cOnly a monopolist can make a product worse and still make more money,\u201d Dahlquist argued. Google\u2019s lawyer John Schmidtlein countered that Google\u2019s share of U.S. digital advertising revenue has steadily decreased. He touted the advertising power of rival platforms ByteDance's TikTok, Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, and Amazon. Schmidtlein argued that Google is \u201cconstrained\u201d by rival platforms \"where the eyeballs are,\" because advertisers know there are overlapping audiences and can spend their dollars elsewhere. He also asserted that Google was continually moving to innovate its search advertising products. \u201cIf Google is a monopolist, why improve anything? Why not just jack the price up?\u201d he told the court. He later argued that \"Google has won with a superior product.\" The Justice Department has hammered away at Google in a trial that started on Sept. 12, contending the search engine giant is a monopolist that illegally abused its power to boost profits. Witnesses from Verizon (VZ.N)  , Android maker Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   and Google itself testified about the company's annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share. Mehta also took up the government\u2019s claim that Google intentionally destroyed internal documents that were relevant to the issues in the lawsuit. The government asked Mehta to presume that Google deleted chats that were unfavorable to the company. Mehta repeatedly questioned Google's prior policies, which he said left document retention decisions to its employees. \"They should have been preserved. Should there be some consequence for what at a minimum was far from best practices?\" the judge asked. A lawyer for Google, Colette Connor, defended its data preservation practices, calling them reasonable, and urged the court not to sanction the company. The case, filed by former President Donald Trump's administration, was the first of several aimed at reining in the market power of tech leaders. Another case, against Facebook parent Meta, was also filed during the Trump administration. President Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers have followed with a second case against Google and cases against Amazon.com (AMZN.O)   and Apple Inc (AAPL.O)  ."

        "content": "LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Johnson Controls International (JCI.N)   is considering the sale of its ADT alarms business as it offloads some non-core businesses, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The unit of the New York-listed building manufacturer operates in Europe and Latin America and has already drawn interest from private equity funds, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The preparations are at an early stage and a sale process could happen towards the end of the year, one of the people said. Shares of Johnson Controls International rose after the news, trading at $61.81, up 1.7% at 1437 GMT. The alarms unit could fetch a valuation of less than $1 billion in the event of a sale, the person said. Johnson Controls does not break down financials for the unit. \"We constantly evaluate ways to improve our business and serve our customers better; however, we don't comment on rumor or market speculation,\" a spokesperson for Johnson Control told Reuters. The alarms business sits under Johnson's Building Solutions European and Latin American segment, which saw sales increase by 3% to $1.1 billion in its most recent quarter, according to its latest results. That business saw adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) jump by 29% to $89 million in the period. Johnson Controls has been attempting to divest its portfolio of heating and ventilation assets as part of its efforts to offload non-core businesses. Reuters reported in March that Robert Bosch GmbH (ROBG.UL), Lennox International (LII.N) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) were among the industrial firms competing to buy these assets. Johnson Controls makes a range of appliances and equipment for commercial buildings and homes. Founded in 1885, the group inherited the fire and security business after its merger with Tyco International in 2016."

        "content": "May 3 (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL.O) quarterly results and forecast beat modest expectations on Thursday, as the iPhone maker unveiled a record share buyback program, sending its stock up 6% in extended trade. Apple increased its cash dividend by 4% and authorized an additional program to buy back $110 billion of stock. The buyback is the largest in the company's history. Apple's quarterly revenue fell, but less than analysts had expected, and CEO Tim Cook said revenue growth would return in the current quarter. The results and guidance suggest the company may be regaining its footing in the smartphone market, despite stiff competition and regulatory challenges. The surge in Apple's shares following its report lifted its stock market value by over $160 billion. Apple said fiscal second-quarter revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $90.01 billion, according to LSEG data. For Apple's current quarter, which ends in June, Cook told Reuters the iPhone maker expects \"to grow low-single digits\" in overall revenue. Wall Street expected 1.33% revenue growth to $82.89 billion, according to LSEG data. Long considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling 10% this year as it struggles with weak iPhone demand and tough competition in China. Apple expects current-quarter services and iPad revenue to grow by double digits, CFO Luca Maestri told analysts on a conference call. The company expects gross margins of between 45.5% and 46.5% for the fiscal third quarter. Apple faces a raft of challenges across its business. Smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) have introduced competing devices aimed at hosting artificial-intelligence chatbots. On the regulatory front, Apple's services business, which contains its lucrative App Store and was one of the few areas of growth in the fiscal second quarter, is under pressure from a new law in Europe. In the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market and driving up prices. For the fiscal second quarter, iPhone sales fell 10.5% to $45.96 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $46 billion. Apple executives said in February that the year-ago fiscal second quarter had benefited from a $5 billion surge in iPhone sales as the company caught up from supply-chain snarls during pandemic lockdowns. Excluding that one-time phenomenon, iPhone sales were down only slightly as the Cupertino, California, company's signature product faces stiff competition. In China, Huawei Technology (HWT.UL) has gained market share. Cook said that iPhone sales still experienced \"growth in some markets, including China.\" Apple's revenue decline in China was not as steep as analysts expected, with Greater China sales of $16.37 billion for the fiscal second quarter that ended March 30, down 8.1% and above analyst expectations of $15.59 billion, according to data from Visible Alpha. Apple has said little about its product plans for artificial intelligence, the technology on which rivals Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google are placing huge bets. The company started ramping up research and development spending last year, and Cook said the company has spent more than $100 billion on R&D in the past five years. \"We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI and we're making significant investments,\" he said. \"We're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers\" at events later this year, Cook said. As it races to bring AI into its products, Apple's massive buyback program may appease investors who have been bruised by its sinking stock price. \"It's certainly a great time to resort to this strategy as, on the one hand, the stock remains relatively fairly priced, and, on the other hand, it needs to garner solid support for a structural shift that may very well take several quarters to play out,\" Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said in a client note. Apple's quarterly earnings per share were $1.53, above Wall Street estimates of $1.50, according to LSEG data. Sales in Apple's services segment, which also represents Apple Music and TV offerings, rose to $23.87 billion, above analyst expectations of $23.27 billion, according to LSEG data. Analysts had expected Mac sales to decline in the fiscal second quarter, but they instead grew to $7.5 billion, compared with estimates of $6.86 billion, according to LSEG data. \"They were really driven by the strength of the new MacBook Air that's powered by the M3 chip,\" Cook said. \"About half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter were new to the Mac.\" The company's sales in the iPad segment declined to $5.56 billion, below analyst expectations of $5.91 billion. In the company's wearables segment, which represents sales of Apple Watches and AirPods headphones, sales fell to $7.91 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $8.08 billion, according to LSEG data."

The Justice Department hammered away at Google in a trial that started on Sept. 12, arguing the search engine giant is a monopolist and illegally abused its power to favor its bottom line. The second day of closing arguments is set for Friday. The judge noted that during the trial, Microsoft (MSFT.O)   acknowledged it did not invest enough in mobile search. \"That's not anticompetitive, the fact that Google was smart enough to get on the mobile bandwagon before Microsoft,\" Mehta said. The government agreed, but responded that a \"mistake by one rival doesn't mean Google gets to monopolize this market forever.\" But Mehta directed tough questions to Google's lawyer, questioning if any competitor could displace Google on mobile phones. Google lawyer John Schmidtlein rejected contentions the company had engaged in anticompetitive conduct. This case, filed by the Trump administration, was the first of five aimed at reining in the market power of tech leaders. The second, against Facebook parent Meta, was also filed during the Trump administration, while Biden's antitrust enforcers have followed with a second case against Google and cases against Amazon.com (AMZN.O)   and Apple Inc (AAPL.O)  . In this non-jury trial, Mehta will weigh whether Google violated the law, and will later look at any punishment, if needed. A decision is expected later this year. Witnesses from Verizon (VZ.N)  , Android maker Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   and Google itself testified about the company's annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to ensure that its search is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share. In his testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the importance of making its search engine the default on phones, tablets and laptops to keep users loyal, saying, \"We definitely see value.\" In turn, Google has argued the government was wrong to allege it broke the law to hold onto its massive market share, saying its search engine was wildly popular because of its quality and that dissatisfied users can easily switch. Despite Google's multibillion-dollar payments and Pichai's statement, Google's lawyers have argued that being the default has limited value and that users will not stick around if they are unhappy."

        "content": "ICHEON, South Korea, May 2 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix (000660.KS)   said on Thursday that its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI chipsets were sold out for this year and almost sold out for 2025 as businesses aggressively expand artificial intelligence services. The Nvidia (NVDA.O)   supplier and the world's second-largest memory chipmaker will begin sending samples of its latest HBM chip, called the 12-layer HBM3E, in May and begin mass producing them in the third quarter. \"The HBM market is expected to continue to grow as data and (AI) model sizes increase,\" Chief Executive Officer Kwak Noh-Jung told a news conference. \"Annual demand growth is expected to be about 60% in the mid-to long-term.\" SK Hynix which competes with U.S. rival Micron (MU.O)   and domestic behemoth Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   in HBM was until March the sole supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia, according to analysts who add that major AI chip purchasers are keen to diversify their suppliers to better maintain operating margins. Nvidia commands some 80% of the AI chip market. Micron has also said its HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and that the majority of its 2025 supply was already allocated. It plans to provide samples for its 12-layer HBM3E chips to customers in March. \"As AI functions and performance are being upgraded faster than expected, customer demand for ultra-high-performance chips such as the 12-layer chips appear to be increasing faster than for 8-layer HBM3Es,\" said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , which plans to produce its HBM3E 12-layer chips in the second quarter, said this week that this year's shipments of HBM chips are expected to increase more than three-fold and it has completed supply discussions with customers. It did not elaborate further. Last month, SK Hynix announced a $3.87 billion plan to build an advanced chip packaging plant in the U.S. state of Indiana with an HBM chip line and a 5.3 trillion won ($3.9 billion) investment in a new DRAM chip factory at home with a focus on HBMs. Kwak said investment in HBM differed from past patterns in the memory chip industry in that capacity is being increased after making certain of demand first. By 2028, the portion of chips made for AI, such as HBM and high-capacity DRAM modules, is expected to account for 61% of all memory volume in terms of value from about 5% in 2023, SK Hynix's head of AI infrastructure Justin Kim said. Last week, SK Hynix said in a post-earnings conference call that there may be a shortage of regular memory chips for smartphones, personal computers and network servers by the year's end if demand for tech devices exceeds expectations.

        "content": "May 1 (Reuters) - Qualcomm (QCOM.O)   on Wednesday forecast quarterly sales and adjusted profit above Wall Street expectations, driven by selling more and pricier chips into Android smartphones with artificial-intelligence features. After a smartphone slump last year, Qualcomm said that China's Android market - which has become critical to the company - has started to pick up, with consumers there shifting toward purchasing higher-priced devices that can accommodate AI chatbots. Qualcomm shares were up 4% in after-hours trading. The company said its sales to Chinese smartphone makers have grown 40% in the first half of its fiscal year, a sign of recovery in that market. \"AI is driving a lot of silicon content in those devices because of the expected computational capability to run those models,\" Chief Executive Cristiano Amon told analysts on a conference call. \"Users want to buy a more capable phone that can run AI.\" Qualcomm has faced competition from Huawei Technologies Co (HWT.UL), which last year introduced a flagship 5G smartphone that uses its own chip made by subsidiary HiSilicon. But IDC analyst Phil Solis said that for the moment, it appears that a general trend toward more capable devices is helping Qualcomm more than Huawei's competition is hurting the San Diego, California, company. \"The Chinese smartphone market is recovering and shifting more to premium phones, so while HiSilicon takes share with flagship Huawei phones, the total market is growing, especially where Qualcomm gets most of its revenue from,\" Solis said. Qualcomm forecast third-quarter sales and adjusted profit with midpoints of $9.2 billion and $2.25 per share, beating analyst estimates of $9.05 billion and $2.17 per share, according to LSEG data. Qualcomm is the world's biggest supplier of chips for smartphones and counts both Apple (AAPL.O)   and Samsung (005930.KS)   as customers. Qualcomm's forecast for the recovery in China's smartphone market recovery may not extend to Apple's iPhone. Apple reports results late on Thursday, and analysts expect its deepest quarterly revenue decline in over a year as it wrestles with competition in China from Huawei and other companies selling cheaper smartphones. While Qualcomm executives talked about signs of recovery among Android handset customers such as Oppo and Vivo, wireless connectivity chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO.O)   on Wednesday forecast quarterly results below Wall Street estimates, saying it expected weak demand from the flagship smartphone market, sending its shares down more than 11% in after-market trading. Qorvo depends more heavily on Apple sales than Qualcomm. For Qualcomm's fiscal second quarter ended March 24, sales and adjusted profit were $9.39 billion and $2.44 per share, respectively, above analyst expectations of $9.34 billion and $2.32, according to LSEG data. Qualcomm is hoping to benefit from consumer demand to upgrade devices to run AI chatbots directly on the device rather than going over to a data center. In a challenge to Apple, Qualcomm plans to release a chip designed to power laptops starting this summer, though that small amount of early sales is unlikely to play a major role in the company's third-quarter forecast, analysts said. In Qualcomm's chip segment, the company forecast fiscal third-quarter sales with a midpoint of $7.8 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $7.74 billion, according to LSEG data. Qualcomm predicted third-quarter patent-licensing sales with a midpoint of $1.3 billion, compared with estimates of $1.29 billion. For the just-ended fiscal second quarter, Qualcomm said chip and licensing revenues were $8.03 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $7.95 billion and $1.32 billion, according to LSEG. Within Qualcomm's chip business, the company said that mobile handsets generated $6.18 billion in sales in the second quarter, compared with estimates of $6.23 billion, according to data from Visible Alpha. Automotive and Internet-of-Things chip revenues in the second quarter were $603 million and $1.24 billion, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $578.9 million and $1.22 billion. \"Demand for all their products overall seems strong,\" said analyst Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies. \"The auto business is particularly interesting as they keep growing while others who compete there keep struggling.\""

        "content": "May 1 (Reuters) - Apple's (AAPL.O)   plan to add generative AI to its iPhones and revive sagging sales in the crucial Chinese market will be in focus on Thursday, when the tech giant is expected to report its biggest quarterly revenue decline in more than a year. Long considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple shares have underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling more than 10% this year as fears mount about its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence services and as a resurgent Huawei (HWT.UL) takes market share in China. Analysts on average see iPhone sales, which account for about half of Apple's revenue, falling 10.4% in the first three months of 2024, according to LSEG. That drop would be the steepest in more than three years. The year-ago iPhone revenue that the 10.4% iPhone sales drop is measured against was unusually high as Apple satisfied pent-up demand after the COVID pandemic, company executives previously noted. At least $5 billion of the $51.3 billion in iPhone sales a year ago was essentially catching up from disruptions in the December 2022 quarter when COVID lockdowns in China hampered iPhone production, executives said. Even with that factored in, Wall Street expects a slight decline in iPhone sales, and analysts estimate Apple's total revenue declined 5% in its fiscal second quarter ended in March. That would be Apple's biggest revenue decline since the December 2022 quarter, when revenue fell 5.5%. Apple earlier this year lost the crown of the world's most valuable company to Microsoft (MSFT.O). Its market value stands at $2.68 trillion after the share price declined 11.24% so far this year. Weak revenue and falling shares have pressured Apple to spruce up its flagship device after years without major upgrades. The company is in talks with OpenAI and Alphabet-owned Google to add genAI features for the iPhone that could be unveiled at what is expected to be its biggest-ever annual developer conference in June, Bloomberg News has reported. Analysts believe such an AI integration could drive demand for the next iPhone series, expected to be announced in the fall. While executives at Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms (META.O) and other major technology firms have talked up their AI strategies on quarterly conference calls in recent months, Apple CEO Tim Cook has discussed his plans for the emerging technology much less. Adding AI features to iPhones could also help Apple to compete better with Huawei and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), which reclaimed the title of the world's top smartphone vendor from Apple this year, driven by demand for the AI features in its Galaxy S24 smartphones. \"Replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said this week as he upgraded the company's shares to \"outperform\" from \"market-perform.\" \"We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note historically Apple's China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base.\" Thursday's earnings will also be watched closely for updates on the company's stock buyback plan and the Vision Pro, Apple's first major product in years that hit the shelves in February. After initial enthusiasm, there have been signs that demand slowed for the $3,500 device, with an analyst saying this month that Apple has pulled back its production estimates for the mixed-reality headset. The rest of the company's hardware business is also reeling from soft demand, with iPads and Mac sales expected to fall 11.4% and 4.3%, respectively, in the March quarter. Apple has signaled it is sharpening its focus on the devices, which have also been hobbled by a lack of major upgrades. At an Apple event this month, a revamped iPad line-up is expected to be unveiled and media reports have said that it plans to update every Mac model with faster, AI-focused M4 processors. The services business, which includes App Store and subscription services such as Apple TV, is expected to remain a bright spot with revenue growth of 7.7%. Apple shares closed down 0.6% at $169.30 on Wednesday."

The chip company forecasts revenue of $900 million, plus or minus 2%, in the third quarter, below analysts' average estimate of $1.02 billion, according to LSEG data. It expects adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share for the third quarter. The company sees its \"mobile business to be down sequentially, below normal seasonal patterns, as excess inventory clears. In broad markets, we anticipate further modest growth as inventory levels appear to be normalizing in certain end markets\" in the third quarter, according to Skyworks' CFO Kris Sennesael. Skyworks gets most of its revenue from selling radio frequency and other chips used in smartphones made by Apple (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), among others. Global smartphone shipments increased 7.8% to 289.4 million units during January-March, with Samsung, at 20.8% market share, clinching the top phonemaker spot from Apple, data from research firm IDC showed earlier in April. Apple's smartphone shipments dropped about 10% in the first quarter of 2024, according to IDC. Skyworks' revenue for the quarter ended March 29 was $1.05 billion, in line with analyst estimates."

Shares of the New York-based company rose more than 3% in premarket trading. After a period of sluggish spending by wireless carriers on its fiber optic cables, Corning is seeing a recovery as telecom clients upgrade their infrastructure along with more uses for the company's products in data centers, which power artificial intelligence applications. The company had said in January it expects carrier customers to deplete their excess inventory and resume normal purchasing patterns. \"We're seeing encouraging signs of improving market conditions,\" said Corning CEO Wendell Weeks. Tech firms have been ramping up spending on products such as fiber optic cables, connectors, optical components and infrastructure which can handle large AI workloads, benefiting companies like Corning. \"We are executing our plans to add more than $3 billion in annualized sales within the next three years,\" Weeks said. Corning expects second-quarter core sales of about $3.4 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $3.33 billion, according to LSEG data. The company, which makes Gorilla Glass used in smartphones by companies such as Samsung (005930.KS)   and Apple (AAPL.O)  , reported first-quarter total core sales of $3.26 billion, beating estimates of $3.12 billion. Revenue for the company's optical communications segment, its largest by sales, was at $930 million, versus estimates of $866.7 million. On an adjusted basis, it earned 38 cents per share, compared with estimates of 35 cents per share."

The 26-year-old from Derby, England, the first breaker to land a sponsorship deal with Nike and a Samsung Galaxy ambassador, is using his breaking community's \"superpower\" to climb the rankings as he prepares for the Olympic Qualifying Series (OQS). \"When I started breaking, I was in a crew and I looked up to that crew and that was my community. And I had older people to sort of guide me through life experiences and breaking experiences. And the community for me is still there,\" Singh told Reuters. \"The community makes me who I am. Some people allow being from a smaller place to hold them back, but for me, I allowed it to be a superpower. You know, I wanted to turn up to big events, kind of arrive unknown and leave unforgettable.\" Breaking, an acrobatic style of street dancing, is making its Olympic debut in Paris and Singh will have the perfect opportunity to make his mark on the Place de la Concorde if he claims one of the 10 qualifying spots available at events in Shanghai and Budapest starting in May. Singh will represent Britain and his crew. \"I feel like at first when we had the Olympic announcement, some people were for, some people were against even within our own scene. But I think the more it's gone on, the way that it's been exposed to this new world, I think it's done really, really well,\" said Singh, who stars in the Sky feature film Breaking Point. \"I think generally it's attracting a new demographic to breaking and to dance in general, because as much as breaking is a sport, like I said, it's still a dance, a sport of culture. You can do it for fun or you can do it to be the best in the world.\""

        "content": "SEOUL, April 30 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   forecast demand for artificial intelligence would hold strong and tighten supply of some high-end chips, joining rivals in benefiting from a solid rebound in the battered global memory chip market. The upbeat outlook from the world's largest memory chip maker sent its shares 1.8% higher on Tuesday after it reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit. But so far this year Samsung shares are down 0.8%, lagging SK Hynix's (000660.KS)   24% gain, as it seeks to catch up with its smaller rival in the supply of top-end chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) to AI leader Nvidia (NVDA.O)  . \"We plan to increase supply of HBM-related chips in 2024 by more than three-fold versus last year,\" Jaejune Kim, a Samsung vice president in charge of the memory division, said on an earnings call. Samsung said it began mass production this month of the latest HBM chips for use in generative AI chipsets, called 8-layer HBM3E. It is seeking to capitalise on the AI boom that has benefited SK Hynix, which had been the sole supplier of HBM3 chips to Nvidia. Samsung said it planned to start making the 12-layer version during the second quarter, and expected the latest HBM3E products to account for two-thirds of its HBM output by year-end. Analysts said the targets were aggressive. Samsung's 8-layer HBM3E appears to be supplying Nvidia, while the 12-layer may go to AMD (AMD.O)   and Nvidia, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. \"As Samsung's technology is advantageous for high-stacking, while SK Hynix has its advantages in the 8-layer, there may be a segmentation where Nvidia gets 12-layer products from Samsung and most 8-layer products from SK Hynix,\" Kim said. \"Samsung is working hard to improve the yield of its 12-layer product.\" Samsung did not respond immediately to a request for comment on its HBM customers. Samsung also said it will step up offerings of high-end solid-state drive (SSD) products to meet AI server demand, and expected high-end memory chip supply to become tighter toward year-end due to capacity being focused on HBM, echoing comments from SK Hynix last week. The South Korean company's first-quarter revenue rose 13% to 71.9 trillion won ($52.14 billion), including a 96% increase in memory chip revenue to 17.49 trillion won as prices rose steeply from a severe downturn, partly thanks to the boom in AI. Operating profit rose to 6.6 trillion won in January-March, up from 640 billion won a year earlier. It was the company's highest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. The chip division, historically Samsung's cash cow business that used to account for two-thirds of its operating profit, swung to a profit of 1.91 trillion won in the March quarter from a 4.58 trillion won loss a year earlier. It was the first profit since the third quarter of 2022. Prices of NAND flash chips used to store data increased by 23% to 28% during the first quarter versus the previous quarter, while prices of DRAM chips used in tech devices rose by about 20%, according to data provider TrendForce. Samsung's mobile devices business booked a 3.51 trillion won operating profit in the first quarter, down from 3.94 trillion won a year earlier. It shipped about 60 million smartphones during the quarter, in line with a year earlier but retaking its title as the world's top smartphone vendor from Apple (AAPL.O)  , which is suffering a sales decline in China. Rising costs, including increased memory chip prices, dented margins from its flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones launched during the quarter. Samsung said AI functions were driving sales of S24 phones, allowing the division to maintain double-digit profitability in the first quarter. About 50% of customers said they bought S24 phones for the AI functions, and 60% were regularly using the AI functions, the company said. ($1 = 1,374.1900 won)"

        "content": "AMSTERDAM, April 25 (Reuters) - ASML's (ASML.AS) new boss Christophe Fouquet faces a tricky balancing act in helping to steer Europe's biggest tech company through the US/China \"chip war\", while maintaining the group's lead over rivals and managing the current AI boom. Fouquet, whose appointment as CEO was approved at the semiconductor equipment maker's annual meeting on Wednesday, inherits a company that is profitable and dominant in its field, but potential pitfalls abound. Export restrictions imposed by the United States and the Netherlands mean the upper half of ASML's product range cannot be sold in China, one of its biggest markets. As Fouquet takes over, ASML is riding high with a lofty stock market valuation, reflecting optimistic expectations but there are risks of disappointment amid a product rollout and capacity expansion. Outgoing CEO Peter Wennink, who presided over a more than tenfold rise in the company's market valuation to 320 billion euros ($340 billion) over the past decade, said in a farewell address ASML's expansion will continue under Fouquet. The global semiconductor industry has grown to $600 billion in annual sales in a 50-year history, but, Wennink said, \"in the next six to eight years, we need to almost double that. This is why we need to build capacity. This is why our customers will grow ... and that's why ASML will grow.\" Fouquet will have to maintain ASML's position as the dominant vendor of its lithography systems, which use beams of light to create the circuitry of chips, to the likes of Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), Intel(INTC.O), and Samsung (005930.KS). Lithography makes up about a third of the $100 million chip equipment market, and ASML has a market share above 90%, analysts say, as it is the only company with \"EUV\" lithography, used to make all of the world's most advanced chips. Competitors for older generations of \"DUV\" lithography include Japan's Nikon (7731.T) and Canon(7751.T), but Fouquet will also have to watch Chinese lithography company SMEE and others that may emerge. Chinese chipmakers have big incentives to develop alternatives to ASML machines they cannot buy under U.S.-led restrictions. These have become a headache for ASML since 2018, as Washington seeks to limit Beijing's ability to make its own advanced chips. Chinese chipmakers are expanding capacity to make older chips that do not fall under restrictions, agitating Washington and Brussels. China was ASML's second-largest market by sales in 2023. In addition, China's chipmakers will continue to improve the quality of chips they can make using ASML's DUV equipment. ASML cannot sell EUV tools in China. Fouquet explained to shareholders Wednesday that using DUV instead of EUV tools becomes more and more inefficient as chips get more advanced, until it is prohibitively expensive. So \"technically you can, economically you can't. I think that's the short answer,\" Fouquet said, an argument he must also make to governments seeking further restrictions. Fouquet oversaw ASML's EUV programmes in 2018-2022, including the development of the new $375 million \"High NA\" EUV machine currently being tested by Intel expected to support sales growth into the 2030s. A source who has worked with Fouquet described him as able to keep people talking even when pressure on a key supplier to improve its technology and triple its output at the same time led to fierce arguments. \"He understands the technology, he understands the business and then also he understands how to make things work\" across U.S. designers, European suppliers, and Asian customers, the source said. Fouquet, a trained physicist, will need his diplomatic skills, especially if Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidency in November with an unpredictable impact on China policy. ASML grew from 13,000 employees in 2014 to 43,000 at present - and on Monday the company unveiled plans for a new facility in Eindhoven to house another 20,000 staff. The company's stock is priced at 40 times 2023 earnings, slightly ahead of other top chip equipment suppliers such as Applied Materials (AMAT.O) and KLA (KLAC.O). Fouquet worked at both earlier in his career. Investor Nick Rossolillo, who hosts the Chip Stock Investor podcast and has owned ASML shares since 2022, said one concern is that governments are supporting construction of new chip plants in U.S., Japan, Europe, China, South Korea and Taiwan. \"Government subsidies are fantastic for ... equipment providers like ASML during this construction boom. But what happens in 2028-30 when all that extra capacity comes online?\" Rossolillo said. ($1 = 0.9349 euros)"

The results are the latest sign that demand for memory chips is improving, after earnings of larger rivals Micron Technology (MU.O)   and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   also showed a rebound in prices of the semiconductors following a severe downturn. \"We are in the early innings of unlocking the full potential of this company, and as industry supply and demand dynamics continue to improve, we will remain disciplined around our capital spending,\" said Western Digital CEO David Goeckeler. Goeckeler is set to lead the company's flash memory business after its planned separation from the traditional hard-disk drive unit, expected to complete in the second half of 2024. Western Digital said its revenue rose 23% to $3.46 billion in the three months ended March 29, beating LSEG estimates of $3.36 billion. Its adjusted earnings per share of 63 cents were also higher than expectations of 21 cents. Revenue from the cloud market grew 29% to $1.55 billion as the company benefited from higher shipments of memory products used in data centers as well as increased per-unit pricing. Western Digital forecast its current-quarter revenue to be between $3.60 billion and $3.80 billion, in line with analysts' estimate of $3.69 billion. Shares of the company were down about 1% in extended trading."

        "content": "SEOUL, April 25 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS)   said it expected a full recovery in memory chips on AI demand, posting its highest profit in nearly two years on sales of advanced DRAM chips with high bandwidth memory (HBM) for use in generative AI chipsets. The world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 2.89 trillion won ($2.1 billion) operating profit for the March quarter versus a loss of 3.4 trillion won a year earlier, beating a 1.88 trillion won projection by LSEG SmartEstimate weighted towards analysts that are more consistently accurate. \"The memory market is entering into full recovery cycle with ongoing strength of AI demand,\" SK Hynix said. With chipmakers focusing production capacity more on chips to meet AI-driven demand, there may be a shortage of regular memory chips for smartphones, personal computers and network servers by year-end if demand for tech devices exceeds expectations, Hynix said. Thursday's result marks Hynix's second-highest profit for the January-March quarter ever, a quick turnaround from heavy losses incurred in the year through the third quarter of 2023 as the global memory chip sector went through its worst downturn in decades, hit by a slump in demand for tech devices post-COVID. Among memory chipmakers, SK Hynix is the biggest beneficiary of the explosive increase in AI adoption, as it became the main supplier of HBM chips for Nvidia's (NVDA.O)   graphic processing units that train AI systems. SK Hynix has been the sole supplier of HBM3 to Nvidia, which has 80% of the market for AI chips, and began mass production of the latest version of HBM chips, called HBM3E, with shipments going to the U.S. firm. Rival Micron (MU.O), however, also said its HBM chips were sold out for 2024 and a majority of its 2025 supply was already allocated, and industry No.1 Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) plans to ship its latest and most powerful HBM chips in the third quarter. \"Competition in HBM will intensify, sales prices will fall, and SK Hynix's market share will likely fall from the second half of this year,\" said Pak Yuak, analyst at Kiwoom Securities. To stay ahead, SK Hynix announced this month a $3.87 billion investment to build an advanced chip packaging plant in Indiana with an HBM chip line, and a 5.3 trillion won investment to build a new South Korean DRAM chip factory with focus on HBMs. It will collaborate with TSMC (2330.TW) to develop the next version of HBM chips, called HBM4, as well as chip packaging that can produce custom HBM chips. Its NAND flash chip business swung to profit in the first quarter, as demand for enterprise solid-state drives (eSSDs) spiked from on-premises AI data centres wanting storage drives that can handle heavy workloads and consume less power. SK Hynix said its plant in Dalian, China, is producing 144-layer and 192-layer NAND flash chips that will respond to this new AI-driven demand. ($1 = 1,374.6200 won)"

Caltech and HP told the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas   on Tuesday that they would dismiss the case with prejudice, which means it cannot be refiled. A spokeperson for HP said on Wednesday that the company was \"pleased to have this matter resolved.\" Representatives for Caltech did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment and more information, including on whether a settlement had been reached. Caltech previously won a $1.1 billion jury verdict against Apple (AAPL.O)   and Broadcom (AVGO.O)   in a lawsuit over some of the same patents, though a U.S. appeals court ordered a retrial on the damages amount. The school has since settled that case as well as related lawsuits against Samsung [RIC:RIC:SMELA.UL] and Microsoft (MSFT.O)  . The university has also sued Dell [RIC:RIC:DI.UL] for patent infringement in a case that is still ongoing. Caltech sued Palo Alto, California-based HP in 2020, accusing several lines of HP personal computers of infringing patents related to international Wi-Fi standards. HP has previously denied the allegations and asked the court to dismiss the case. The case is California Institute of Technology v.

Shares of the company rose nearly 8% in extended trading. The growing demand for memory and networking chips driven by increased appetite for artificial intelligence applications is benefiting semiconductor-testing equipment suppliers like Teradyne. \"Strength in memory and computing is driving stronger than expected performance in the first half of the year, however visibility beyond the second quarter remains limited,\" said CEO Greg Smith. The company, which supplies equipment to chip designer Qualcomm (QCOM.O)   and electronics firm Samsung (005930.KS)  , said it expects second-quarter revenue in the range of $665 million to $725 million, compared with estimates of $636.6 million, according to LSEG data. It also expects adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter in the range of 64 cents to 84 cents, compared with estimates of 60 cents. The company's revenue for the first quarter fell around 3% to $600 million from a year ago. However, it beat analysts' expectations of $566.3 million. On a adjusted basis, the company earned 51 cents per share in the quarter ending March 31, compared with estimates of 33 cents per share."

        "content": "BEIJING, April 23 (Reuters) - Apple's smartphone shipments in China tumbled 19% in the first quarter of the year, the worst performance since 2020, as the iPhone maker took a hit from Huawei's (HWT.UL) new product launches in the premium segment, market data showed. Apple's share in the world's biggest smartphone market fell to 15.7% in the first quarter from 19.7% a year earlier. That put it almost level with Huawei, which saw sales jump 70%, according to research firm Counterpoint. Apple (AAPL.O) lost its crown as the biggest smartphone seller in China to rival Vivo, sliding to third place in the quarter, followed by Huawei whose market share jumped to 15.5% from 9.3% a year earlier. Honor, a mass market brand spun out of Huawei, was in second place. \"Huawei\u2019s comeback has directly impacted Apple in the premium segment. Besides, the replacement demand for Apple has been slightly subdued compared to previous years,\" said Counterpoint analyst Ivan Lam in a press release. \"For the second quarter, the possibility of new color options combined with aggressive sales initiatives could bring the brand back into positive territory,\" Lam said, adding it is seeing slow but steady improvement in weekly iPhone sales. China is Apple's third-biggest market and generated around 17% of its total revenue in the October-December quarter. Its market share loss in China comes after separate data showed earlier this month that the U.S. firm suffered nearly a 10% drop in global smartphone shipments in the first quarter of 2024, hurt by intensifying competition by Android smartphone makers led by Samsung Electronics (005930.KS). Samsung clinched the top phonemaker spot from Apple in the first quarter. Shares of Apple slipped 0.4% in premarket trade on Tuesday. The stock has fallen about 14% so far this year and posted its worst weekly performance in over eight months on Friday. Throughout the first quarter, Apple launched campaigns in China to entice consumers with discounts, including subsidizing certain iPhone models by as much as 1,300 yuan ($180). Huawei last week released its Pura 70 series of high-end phones after launching the Mate 60 series in August. The Mate 60 was seen as a comeback for the Chinese firm in the high-end market and described as a triumph over U.S. sanctions on the company, as the handsets contain an advanced China-made chip. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Sunday that the chip powering Huawei's flagship phone is not as advanced as American chips, arguing it showed U.S. curbs on shipments to the telecoms equipment giant are working. Canadian research firm TechInsights expects overall shipments in China this year to top 50 million units, including 10 million for the Pura 70 series. That would make Huawei the No. 1 seller with a 19% market share, up from 12% in 2023. In the first quarter, China's smartphone market grew 1.5%, marking the second consecutive quarter of positive growth, according to Counterpoint."

        "content": "QINGYUAN, China, April 22 (Reuters) - Floods swamped cities in southern China's densely populated Pearl River Delta following record-breaking rains, sparking worries about the region's defences against bigger deluges induced by extreme weather events. The province once dubbed the \"factory floor of the world\" is prone to summer floods. Its defences against disruptive floods were severely tested in June 2022 when Guangdong was pounded by the heaviest downpours in six decades. Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated. Since Thursday, Guangdong has been battered by unusually heavy, sustained and widespread rainfall, with powerful storms ushering in an earlier-than-normal start to the province's annual flooding season in May and June. In Qingyuan, a relatively small city of 4 million, residents counted their losses. \"My rice fields are fully flooded, my fields are gone,\" Huang Jingrong, 61, told Reuters. Huang was sheltering under an overpass with other farmers from his village, alongside an assortment of personal belongings, including a washing machine. \"I won't be making any money this year, I will be making losses,\" he told Reuters, estimating his losses at about 100,000 yuan ($13,800). \"What can we do? We won't get reimbursed for our losses.\" Over the weekend, waterways in Guangdong overflowed including the river near Huang's village, where flood-waters have reached the second storey of houses after washing out paddy and potato fields. In other parts of Qingyuan, rescuers tackled neck-high waters to extract residents including an elderly lady trapped in waist-deep water in an apartment building. Others remained on the upper floors of their houses, waiting for the waters to recede as friends delivered food by boat. Before 2022, it rarely rained as heavily as it does now, and the flood-waters were never as high, said Qingyuan resident Lin Xiuzheng, an online retail sales worker. Weather events in China have become more intense and unpredictable because of global warming, scientists say, with record-breaking rainfall and drought assailing the world's second-largest economy, often at the same time. Precipitation records for April have been broken in many parts of Guangdong, with the cities of Shaoguan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen to the west and north of Guangzhou also half-submerged in flood-waters. The downpours have killed four people and 10 others remain missing in the province as of Monday, state-owned Xinhua News Agency reported. Across the province, 36 houses collapsed while 48 were severely damaged, resulting in a direct economic loss of nearly 140.6 million yuan, Xinhua reported. Two companies told Reuters there had been no immediate impact to business or supply chains. \"Everything's running as usual and everyone got to work,\" said a person who answered the phone at Camelot PCB, a print circuit board company that supplies Tesla (TSLA.O) and other electric vehicle makers. Polyrocks Chemical, a plastics company that supplies technology giants such as Apple (AAPL.O), Huawei and Samsung (005930.KS), also said its operations were not affected. Many rivers remained swollen on Monday, however, at levels above safety thresholds, with rainfall in recent days two to three times more than normal at this time of the year. The intense convective weather in southern China was caused by a stronger-than-normal subtropical high, a semi-permanent high pressure system circulating north of the equator. The subtropical high led to warmer temperatures that drew in more moisture-laden air from the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, Chinese meteorologists said, resulting in the intense precipitation.

        "content": "SINGAPORE/SEOUL, July 24 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics' (005930.KS) fourth-generation high bandwidth memory or HBM3 chips have been cleared by Nvidia (NVDA.O) for use in its processors for the first time, three people briefed on the matter said. But it is somewhat of a muted greenlight as Samsung's HBM3 chips will, for now, only be used in a less sophisticated Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU), the H20, which has been developed for the Chinese market in compliance with U.S. export controls, the people said. It was not immediately clear if Nvidia would use Samsung's HBM3 chips in its other AI processors or if the chips would have to pass additional tests before that could happen, they added. Samsung has also yet to meet Nvidia's standards for fifth-generation HBM3E chips and testing of those chips is continuing, the people added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. Nvidia and Samsung declined to comment. HBM is a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. A key component of GPUs for artificial intelligence, it helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex applications. Nvidia's approval of Samsung's HBM3 chips comes amid soaring demand for sophisticated GPUs created by the generative AI boom that Nvidia and other makers of AI chipsets are struggling to meet. There are only three main manufacturers of HBM - SK Hynix (000660.KS), Micron (MU.O) and Samsung - and with HBM3 also in short supply, Nvidia is keen to see Samsung clear its standards so that it can diversify its supplier base. Nvidia's need to have more access to HBM3 is also set to grow as SK Hynix - the clear leader in the field - plans to increase its HBM3E production and make less HBM3, two of the sources said. SK Hynix declined to comment. Samsung, the world's largest maker of memory chips, has been seeking to pass Nvidia's tests for both HBM3 and HBM3E since last year but has struggled due to heat and power consumption issues, Reuters reported in May, citing sources. Samsung said after the publication of the Reuters article in May that claims of failing Nvidia's tests due to heat and power consumption problems were untrue. Samsung could begin supplying HBM3 for Nvidia's H20 processor as early as August, according to two of the sources. The H20 is the most advanced of three GPUs Nvidia has tailored for the China market after the U.S. tightened export restrictions in 2023, aiming to impede supercomputing and AI breakthroughs that could benefit the Chinese military. In accordance with U.S. sanctions, the H20's computing power has been significantly capped compared to the version sold in non-China markets, the H100. The H20 initially got off to a weak start when deliveries began this year and the U.S. firm priced it below a rival chip from Chinese tech giant Huawei (HWT.UL), Reuters reported in May. But sales are now growing rapidly, separate sources have said. In contrast to Samsung, SK Hynix is the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and has been supplying HBM3 since June 2022. It also began supplying HBM3E in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources have said. Micron has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E."

        "content": "July 23 (Reuters) - Robert Bosch has agreed to acquire Johnson Controls' (JCI.N)   and Hitachi's (6501.T)   residential ventilation businesses for $8 billion, it said on Tuesday, in what will be the German engineering group's largest takeover to date. Bosch said Johnson's heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) business for residential and small commercial applications would strengthen its Bosch Home Comfort arm, boosting the division's sales to 9 billion euros ($9.8 billion) from 5 billion euros currently. Johnson Controls International (JCI) said separately that it stands to receive $6.7 billion in cash from the transaction. Bosch said the addition would strengthen its presence in the United States and Asia, including sales of heat pumps as the company looks to capitalise on global efforts to reduce oil and gas heating to cut greenhouse gases. The sale of the JCI assets includes its North America ducted business and a joint venture with Japanese group Hitachi (6501.T)  , which holds a 40% stake. Bosch said it expects the global market for the heating and cooling of buildings to grow 40% by 2030, driven by technological progress, the fight against climate change and new regulations. The deal will be funded through cash on their balance sheet, the company added. JCI said the transaction includes ductless HVAC production sites in Shimizu, Japan, which Hitachi will acquire. Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung has said the company was looking at bigger, potentially global, acquisition targets and that the group was open to listing some of its divisions on the stock market. Reuters reported last month that Bosch was weighing a bid for U.S. appliances manufacturer Whirlpool (WHR.N)  . Bosch is no longer pursuing such a deal with Whirlpool after deeming the agreement with Johnson Controls and Hitachi more attractive, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. Hartung declined to comment on Whirlpool on Tuesday but said that the Johnson-Hitachi deal would keep the company busy for 12 months. Bosch, which had revenue of about 92 billion euros last year, also makes car parts, factory gear, power tools and home appliances. As part of the deal, Johnson Controls' North America ducted business was valued at a multiple of 16.7 times its 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the company said. Its stake in the air-conditioning joint-venture with Hitachi was valued at a multiple of 7.5 times its 2023 EBITDA. After tax, Johnson Controls is expected to receive net proceeds of about $5 billion for the deal. Lennox International and Samsung Electronics were among suitors competing against Bosch for the Johnson Controls assets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in March. Centerview Partners and Citi acted as Johnson Controls' financial advisers while Simpson Thacher served as its legal adviser. Perella Weinberg Partners and Sullivan & Cromwell advised Bosch.

Apple's foldable iPhone has progressed from the ideation stage, the report said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The company has reached out to suppliers in Asia to make components for the device, the Information reported, adding that iPhone maker has created an internal code name V68 for the product. Foldable smartphones, powered with artificial intelligence features, are expected to trigger demand for the iPhone maker, which faces stiff competition from Honor and Huawei in China and Samsung globally. Samsung unveiled its latest foldable smartphones earlier in July, making its priciest flagship model lighter and slimmer with new AI functions. Global foldable smartphone market grew 49% in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking its highest rate of increase in six quarters, according to a Counterpoint Research report from May, with Huawei taking the top spot for the first time, beating Samsung. Apple also plans to bring an upgrade to a camera of at least one iPhone model, that would let its users to control the size of the aperture with a mechanical system, possibly allowing users to create depth-of-field effect, the Information report added. The report also said that there is no guarantee that Apple would release the foldable iPhone. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment."

The gap between the two sides is too wide to reach any agreement, Lee Hyun-kuk, vice president of the National Samsung Electronics Union whose roughly 30,000 members make up almost a quarter of the company's South Korean workforce, said on a YouTube live broadcast.

        "content": "HONG KONG, July 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - South Korea is often rocked by scandals at its entrenched family-run conglomerates led by Samsung, but its younger technology stars are problematic too. The arrest on Tuesday of billionaire Kim Beom-su, also known as Brian Kim, for stock price manipulation, comes at a delicate time for his Kakao empire. Yet a heavy-handed crackdown on the company could jeopardise the country's new breed of promising global businesses. The founder is accused of inflating the stock price of K-pop   agency, SM Entertainment (041510.KQ)  , which was at the centre of a controversial bidding war in early 2023 between Kakao, SM's current parent, and a rival agency, Hybe (352820.KS)  . Kim has denied any wrongdoing. Shares in his $13 billion holding company Kakao Corp (035720.KS)   had lost a quarter of their value this year, and shed another 5% after news of Kim\u2019s detention emerged. The self-made billionaire's empire is eye-catching. In 2010, Kim launched a messaging app KakaoTalk; today, the platform counts a whopping 93% of the population as users and Kakao has expanded into ride-hailing, payments, gaming, healthcare and more. Kim and affiliated entities control a 24% stake in the holding company which sits atop of over 100 subsidiaries including digital lender Kakao Bank and Japanese comic app Piccoma. Over the past few years, however, the group has lurched from crisis to crisis. Its ride-hailing arm is under scrutiny for unfair business practices, with the country's President Yoon Suk Yeol last year blasting its behaviour as monopolistic and \"very immoral\". The company has also grappled with corporate governance lapses: following spinoffs of Kakao Pay and Kakao Bank, senior executives were under fire for cashing out stock options at the expense of public investors; earlier this year, Kakao Mobility was fined   by financial watchdogs for inflating revenue. Amidst a management revamp, including changing chief executives twice in two years, Kakao created a separate body chaired by Kim tasked with overhauling governance. On one hand, Yoon's pro-business administration will want to send a message that it is serious about cracking down on corporate wrongdoing after it pardoned Samsung Electronic's (005930.KS)   Jay Y. Lee in 2022, who was convicted for bribery in a massive corruption scandal. On the other hand, Kakao and peers represent Korea Inc's next generation that have the potential to go global as pop bands like BTS and Korean dramas like Squid Game take the world by storm. Naver's online comics platform Webtoon (WBTN.O)  , for example, recently raised $315 million in New York. It will be a struggle for Seoul to strike the right balance. Follow @mak_robyn   on X CONTEXT NEWS The billionaire founder of South Korean tech giant Kakao Corp, Kim Beom-su, was arrested on July 23 on accusations of manipulating stocks during the acquisition of a K-Pop agency last year. Prosecutors say Kim, also known as Brian Kim, was involved in manipulation of the stock price of SM Entertainment in February 2023 to hinder a competitor, Hybe, from acquiring the K-Pop agency. Kim has not been charged with wrongdoing and has denied the accusations, saying he has never ordered or tolerated any illegal activity, the company said in a statement. Kim's arrest would last up to 20 days, during which prosecutors are expected to investigate further before bringing charges, according to South Korean criminal procedure. Kakao shares were down 4.6% to 39,150 won during late morning trading in Seoul on July 23."

        "content": "NEW DELHI, July 23 (Reuters) - India announced it will cut import duty on mobile phones and some key parts to 15% from 20%, a move that will directly benefit Apple (AAPL.O), which still imports its high-end smartphones into the country despite increasing local production. Presenting the annual budget for 2024/25 in parliament on Tuesday, India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said import tax on mobile phones, printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and mobile chargers is in the \"interest of consumers.\" Almost 10-12% of the Apple iPhones are imported each year into India and a 5% reduction in tax on the devices will result in a $35-50 million annual benefit to Apple, said Neil Shah, a co-founder at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research. Although Apple has boosted its local production in India through contract manufacturers such as Foxconn (2317.TW) and India's Tata Group, it still imports some of its high-end Pro and Pro Max iPhone models into the country. Apple \"will directly benefit ... they (also) have some models for which PCBAs are still being imported,\" said Shah. The move will also \"alleviate import duties for new players entering the market. It's a gamechanger for them,\" he added. Other manufacturers such as Samsung (005930.KS) would also benefit, but to a lesser degree as the majority of their smartphones are locally made, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple has a 6% share of India's smartphone market, according to Counterpoint. India's deputy IT ministry in January privately argued for a reduction on import taxes on mobile phones, saying the country risks losing out to China and Vietnam in the race to become a major smartphone export hub and must \"act fast\" to lure global companies with lower tariffs, Reuters has reported. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and the nation's $24-billion local production scheme covers mobile phones, prompting companies such as Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo to expand local operations. China's Xiaomi has also in the past asked for tariff reductions on sub-components used in batteries, USB cables and phone covers."

        "content": "NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Athletes on the hunt for Olympic gold will also be chasing likes and follows on social media in Paris, as a battle for a coveted piece of viral fame kicks off at the Games. A social media side hustle unlike any other will play out across a frantic 16 days beginning on July 26 with Olympians looking to exploit a narrow window to connect with fans from the Games on platforms like YouTube, Tik Tok and Instagram. American rugby player Ilona Maher went viral at the Tokyo Olympics and now boasts more than a million followers on Tik Tok, despite her sport having less traction than others in the United States. Her teammate Ariana Ramsey wants to follow a similar path in Paris, hoping the four videos she will be producing each day will build her online persona and help with her ambition to one day start her own athletic apparel brand. \"It is so much pressure because there's only so much you can really plan for,\" she told Reuters. \"I can make a list of content ideas and try and execute them there, but it's going to be more of a matter of like what is going on in the time? What can I capture? What's relevant?\" Like many other Olympians who work second or even third jobs, Ramsey has used social media to supplement her income, earning one-off deals with brands and charging about $100 for an Instagram Reel or $50 for an Instagram story post. In years past, athletes like Ramsey might have needed a manager to negotiate deals with brands. Now, a company will reach out directly to strike a deal. \"This is a whole second job,\" said Ramsey, who also competed in Tokyo. Athletes do not have to be among the top echelons of fame to gain traction online, Kate Johnson, Google's global marketing director, sports, entertainment, and content partnerships, told Reuters. \"You don't have to have a big name. You have something unique to tell and to share that brands want access to,\" she said. The Women's Sports Foundation trustee won silver as a rower in 2004 and sees extraordinary new opportunities for athletes rapidly unfolding since she stepped onto the Olympic podium in Athens. YouTube, which is owned by Google's Alphabet Inc., counted 1 billion unique monthly visitors in 2013. That number roughly doubled by 2022. \"I feel like I have to do a public service announcement for Olympic athletes who have been in the zone, competing, focusing, training and haven't necessarily been paying attention to how to monetize this moment in time for themselves,\" she said. For some, a deep-pocketed sponsor can offer a boost. Visa offered their more than 100 \"Team Visa\" athletes a masterclass in digital storytelling and engagement ahead of the Paris Games, led by social media creators. The course, offered for the first time, included practical instruction on how to use platforms like Tik Tok as well as guidance on digital storytelling. \"Helping in how they are going to engage with their fans and be better and more comfortable kind of in this creative space was something that was of value,\" said Andrea Fairchild, the senior vice president of global sponsorship strategy at Visa. Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) is providing every athlete at the Games with the tools for the job, an Olympic Edition of their new flip phone. The Visa course also educated athletes on how to manage the pitfalls of social media, with online abuse an inevitable reality for athletes. A FIFA report found that one in five players at the 2023 Women's World Cup were subjected to discriminatory or abusive content and even the most enthusiastic content creators acknowledge too much time online comes at a cost. Sportswear brand Asics announced ahead of the Games that it was partnering with data science company Signify to shield its athletes from online harassment. \"We are acutely aware of the negative impact of online harassment and cyberbullying on mental health, and so are keen to help protect our athletes from online abuse,\" Asics' Global Head of Sports Marketing Olivier Mignon said in a statement. Rugby player Maher, who has more than 590,000 followers on Instagram, has not been immune to the \"trolls\" of social media and told reporters at a recent Team USA summit that she treats her online presence as a means to an end. \"Do I wish I had to do it? No,\" she said. \"But I love what it's done for me.\""

        "content": "HANOI, July 19 (Reuters) - Vietnam's ruling Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong died on Friday after holding the country's most powerful position for 13 years during which he oversaw fast economic growth, a years-long anti-graft crackdown and a pragmatic foreign policy. He was 80. Trong's duties have been temporarily assigned to President To Lam, a rising star within the party who could further consolidate his powers if he is allowed to keep the two roles. Trong died in the early afternoon \"due to old age and serious illness\", the Communist Party said in a statement, without elaborating further on the nature of the illness. The statement cited information from Trong's medical team, saying he died \"after a period of illness, despite being wholeheartedly treated by the Party, the State, a collective of professors, doctors, leading medical experts\". Lam had taken over Trong's duties on Thursday as the party chief was ailing. The party will now need to decide whether Lam will be formally appointed as acting party chief until the current term for the post expires in 2026, or whether it will elect a new head before then from within its ranks. Trong hosted both U.S. President Joe Biden and China's leader Xi Jinping in Hanoi last year, boosting relations with both countries despite increasing tensions between the U.S. and China. Biden expressed his condolences, saying he was a champion of deep ties between the United States and Vietnam. The people of both countries \"enjoy greater security and opportunity today because of the friendship between our two countries. That is thanks to him,\" Biden said, praising him for being the first Vietnamese party leader to visit the United States Although Vietnam officially has no paramount ruler, Trong was the country's most powerful figure as party general secretary and had been in the post since 2011. He secured a third term in 2021 after a rule limiting holders to two terms as party boss was waived, demonstrating his strength and significant political clout in a party that has ruled unified Vietnam for nearly half a century. But in recent months, he appeared fragile in public events and missed several top-level meetings. A consolidation of power under Lam was seen by some business people and analysts as potentially positive to speed up decision-making in the Southeast Asian nation, which is home to large factories of top multinationals, including Samsung (005930.KS)  , Intel (INTC.O)  , Canon (7751.T)   and Apple's (AAPL.O)   top supplier Foxconn (2317.TW)  . A clear shift to Lam's leadership \"could moderate political instability and factional infighting, at least in the short term,\" said Peter Mumford, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Eurasia Group, saying that would be beneficial to economic growth. But some diplomats and activists saw also risks of a crackdown on civil liberties and a drift toward more autocratic, China-style rule, if Lam were allowed to concentrate more unchecked powers in his hands, in a break with the party's tradition of collegial decision-making. After Trong's death was announced, public events were cancelled across the country until July 25 while state-run websites had their banners turned black and white. State broadcasters ran a documentary about Trong titled: \"General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong: a steadfast, intellectual, exemplary leader\". Bars in the capital, Hanoi, declined to serve drinks or play music on Friday evening. Several Vietnamese Facebook users changed their profile picture into a national mourning flag. Trong was educated in the Soviet Union and was regarded as a Marxist-Leninist ideologue, but he nonetheless nurtured ties with the United States. In 2017 he unleashed what many saw as a China-style crackdown on corruption, known as \"blazing furnace\", under which hundreds of officials were investigated for graft and many forced to quit, including cabinet ministers, a parliament chairman and two state presidents. The operation had a chilling effect on investment. Lam, a former chief of the powerful internal security agency, has been a key player in that campaign and was elected president in May after his predecessor resigned amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing. China's Communist Party also sent a message of condolence to Vietnam, calling him a \"staunch Marxist\" and \"a good comrade, brother and friend,\" state media reported."

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), a major Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O) supplier and Asia's most valuable listed company, has benefited from the global artificial intelligence boom that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led electronics demand. The chip industry bellwether on Thursday posted a second-quarter net profit that beat market expectations. It raised its 2024 revenue forecast to growth of slight to above the mid-20% range in U.S. dollar terms, versus a previous prediction of an increase in the low to mid-20% range. All three major U.S. stock indexes suffered losses on Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting its biggest one-day drop since December 2022 and the chip sector suffering its largest daily percentage plunge since the pandemic-related shutdown panic of March 2020. \"We're concerned about the plunges of the Nasdaq and chip stocks. It's not just a short-term thing, which we see could consolidate downwards for next two to three months,\" said Allen Huang, a vice president at Mega International Investment Services in Taipei. \"TSMC was dragged down by that trend and Trump's comments, and its earnings did not exceed market expectations by much,\" he added. TSMC's shares had been on a roll until comments published this week from U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that accused Taiwan of stealing America's semiconductor business and said the island should pay the United States to defend it. Taiwan's main index (.TWII) closed 2.3% lower on Friday, while the Taiwan dollar hit its lowest level since May 2016. The American Depository Receipts of TSMC , the world's largest contract chipmaker, eked out a small gain on Thursday, closing up 0.4%, having risen as much as 4% earlier in the day after its earnings call. TSMC has repeatedly said it will keep the bulk of its manufacturing, as well as research and development, in Taiwan, but it is also investing $65 billion to build three factories in the U.S. state of Arizona. TSMC, colloquially referred to the \"sacred mountain protecting the country\" for its critical role in Taiwan's export-dependent economy, faces little competition, though both Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) are trying to challenge that dominance."

Chip stocks in Asia had sold-off earlier in Thursday after a report that the United States was considering tighter curbs on exports of advanced chip technology to China. Bloomberg News had reported that U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was weighing a measure called the foreign direct product rule that would allow the U.S. to stop a product from being sold if it was made using American technology. After the report the Global X Asia Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (3119.HK)   closed down 1.74% on Thursday with declines in major holdings including SK Hynix (000660.KS)  , Tokyo Electron, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) (2330.TW)  , and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  . The Philadelphia Semiconductor index had fallen 6.8% on Wednesday for its weakest day since March 2020. The index had opened up 1.7% on Thursday before falling more than 1% at its low for the day and then closing the session up 0.5%. Its biggest boosts were from Broadcom, up 2.9%, and Nvidia up 2.6%. Their gains helped offset declines in stocks such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), which closed down 2.2% after falling more than 10% on Wednesday, in its biggest sell-off since October 2022. Some analysts cited Wednesday's sell-off as a signal to bargain hunt. Vedvati Shrotre at Evercore ISI wrote that the near-term probability the trade curbs would be implemented is low and pointed to \"near-term weakness as a unique buying opportunity.\" Also Vivek Arya at Bofa cited current volatility as \"enhanced opportunity in companies with best-profitability.\" But Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust expects more volatility ahead with chip company earnings due in coming weeks and both U.S. Presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, \"taking a tough line\" on trade. \"What you were seeing is buying on the weakness and then investors coming to the awareness that this is going to be a recurring concern as we head into the reporting season, that companies with a high level of sales exposure to China may be hurt,\" said Atlanta, Georgia based Morgan. He pointed to an almost 11% tumble in shares of ASML (ASML.AS) on Wednesday to illustrate worries about chip companies that disclose big exposure to China. Investors overlooked strong results at ASML, the biggest supplier of computer chip- making equipment, because roughly half its sales came from China, Morgan said. But he noted that investors were equally worried about Trump implementing tariffs when he was President yet \"chip companies have survived and have done extremely well since then.\" Some of Thursday's volatility may have been caused by investor fears that U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump would make comments about trade in a speech scheduled for later in the day, said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management, El Segundo, CA \"He may suggest more tariffs, which is a concern for technology companies,\" said Goldman. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has already come under pressure from comments from Trump who said earlier this week that Taiwan \"did take about 100% of our chip business\" and should pay the U.S. for its defence. On Thursday TSMC showed some of the biggest declines in Asia, shedding T$1.7 trillion ($52.1 billion) market value in two days. But the manufacturer's U.S. traded shares closed up 0.4% on Thursday. It likely helped that TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, raised its full-year revenue forecast on Thursday on surging artificial intelligence (AI) related demand for chips. In Europe ASML shares had closed down 3.6% in Europe on Thursday while its U.S. listed shares ended down 0.9%. In Asia, South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix had also slid 3.6% while Japan's Tokyo Electron, had slumped 8.75%."

        "content": "July 18 (Reuters) - ChatGPT maker OpenAI is in discussion with chip designers, including Broadcom (AVGO.O)  , about developing a new artificial intelligence chip, the Information reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. OpenAI is exploring the idea of making AI chips on its own to overcome the shortage of expensive graphic processing units that it relies on to develop AI models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and DALL-E3. The Microsoft (MSFT.O)  -backed company is hiring former Google employees who produced the online search giant's own AI chip, the tensor processing unit, and has decided to develop an AI server chip, the report added, citing three people who have been involved. \"OpenAI is having ongoing conversations with industry and government stakeholders about increasing access to the infrastructure needed to ensure AI's benefits are widely accessible,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told the Information. Bloomberg News reported earlier this year that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has plans to raise billions of dollars for setting up a network of factories to manufacture semiconductors with chipmakers Intel (INTC.O)  , Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)   and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   as potential partners."

        "content": "July 17 (Reuters) - Dutch chip equipment startup Nearfield Instruments said it has raised $147.6 million (135 million euros) to ramp up production and bring several tools to market more quickly. Nearfield has developed chipmaking tools designed to measure and inspect silicon wafers to ensure the chips printed on them meet manufacturing standards. The conventional techniques to do so have reached their limits, Nearfield said, and its machines are necessary to ensure that chip production yield remains high with the most advanced processes needed to manufacture artificial intelligence processors. \"What is important after every step of manufacturing is what has been processed is measured - so-called metrology - to make sure it meets what was intended ... to avoid the loss of good chips,\" Nearfield CEO Hamed Sadeghian said in an interview with Reuters. The chip manufacturing equipment sector is dominated by a handful of companies, including ASML (ASML.AS) in the Netherlands and Applied Materials (AMAT.O) in the U.S., that enjoy near monopolies in various subsectors of the equipment market. Startups are rare because of immense barriers to entry. Nearfield, which was founded in 2016, is a rare startup attempting to carve out a portion of the lucrative market for chipmaking equipment. The Rotterdam-based company claims Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) as a customer, and says it is \"engaged\" with other advanced manufacturers. Intel (INTC.O) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW) are the only other chipmakers pursuing advanced techniques. The growth in demand for AI processors has created an opportunity for Nearfield, Sadeghian said. The market for advanced AI chips is set to grow 120% this year to roughly $110 billion, according to Yole Group research. Advanced chips need more than 2,000 process steps, and as the techniques become increasingly complex, Nearfield's inspection equipment is needed more often, Sadeghian said. The 170-employee company plans to use the funding provided by Walden Catalyst and Singapore state fund Temasek - among others - to grow its research and development capabilities and bring several new products to market."

        "content": "THE HAGUE, July 18 (Reuters) - Ten Russian and seven Belarusian athletes cleared to compete in the Paris Olympics have violated the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) rules on neutrality regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine and should be barred, an international rights group said on Thursday. Global Rights Compliance, which tracks violations of international humanitarian law in the conflict and assists war crimes prosecutors in gathering evidence of alleged violations, said it had presented evidence to the IOC substantiating the assertions, but that the committee had ignored its warnings. The athletes in question are among 15 Russians and 16 Belarusians who have been cleared by a review panel established by the IOC and have accepted invitations to compete in the Games, which run from July 26 to Aug. 11, it said. Global Rights Compliance called on the IOC to urgently reconsider the decision to clear the sportsmen and women and to \"ban pro-war athletes according to its own rules and commitments to the United Nations Business and Human Rights Principles\". \"These Olympic Games should be an opportunity for the IOC to affirm and demonstrate its respect for its own human rights policy,\" said Wayne Jordash, president of Global Rights Compliance. He said the IOC was turning a blind eye to the involvement of Russian and Belarusian athletes who have shown support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A spokesperson for the IOC said it could not comment on individual cases or on the decisions of the review panel, which had assessed the athletes according to the agreed guidelines. The IOC had nothing further to add, the spokesperson said. The Russian and Belarusian Olympic Committees did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The IOC condemned Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, for which Moscow used Belarus as a launching pad. The Olympic body has ruled the Russian and Belarusian athletes may compete in Paris only as neutrals, without their national flags or anthems. The IOC also set up the review panel in order to screen out Russian and Belarusian athletes who had publicly supported the war or were contracted to military or national security agencies. Global Rights Compliance said it had determined through open-source investigation that 10 Russians and seven Belarusians had been cleared to compete despite violating those criteria. Among those it named were Russian cyclist Alena Ivanchenko, who it said had \"liked\" a number of pro-war posts on social media, including posts questioning Ukraine's right to exist or supporting Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. The report said Russian tennis player Elena Vesnina had liked posts about \"military feats\" of Russian soldiers killing Ukrainians, and posts displaying the Russian pro-war \"Z\" symbol. Ivanchenko and Vesnina did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Russian canoeist Alexei Korovashkov was named in the report as a member of a sports institution with links to national security agencies. Reuters separately established that he had published, and subsequently deleted, social media posts in 2023 and 2024 in which he used grossly offensive language towards Ukrainians, including in a chat whose name referred to the war. When contacted by a Reuters journalist, Korovashkov did not respond to questions and blocked the reporter from sending further messages. Global Rights Compliance said that since the Russian invasion in February 2022, more than 450 top Ukrainian athletes had been killed in the war. In February, the Ukrainian Olympic Committee asked the IOC to investigate the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes following alleged breaches of neutrality. Global Rights Compliance said it would alert IOC corporate partners including AB InBev, AirBnb, Allianz, Atos, Bridgestone Corporation, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, Intel, Omega, Panasonic, Samsung, Toyota Motor Corporation and Visa that they could be unknowingly complicit in endorsing Russia\u2019s war. AB InBev declined to comment, while Samsung and Visa had no immediate comment. Reuters is seeking comment from the other companies."

The European Commission last month said it would send requests for information to better understand the effects of the deal which would see Samsung embed Google's Gemini Nano in Samsung's Galaxy S24 series smartphones. The move could help the EU antitrust enforcer build a case against the companies if it sees any anti-competitive practices. The questionnaire asked whether the pre-installation of Gemini Nano via the device or the cloud limits the amount of other generative AI systems that may be pre-installed on the same device. Regulators also wanted to know if the pre-installation of Gemini Nano limits interoperability between other chatbots and apps pre-installed on Samsung smartphones. Respondents were asked if they had tried but failed to clinch deals with device manufacturers to pre-install their chatbots and detail the reasons for their rejections. Respondents have until this week to respond to the eight-page questionnaire."

        "content": "AMSTERDAM, July 17 (Reuters) - Shares in ASML (ASML.AS)  , the biggest supplier of computer chip- making equipment, fell sharply on Wednesday on the prospect pressure from the U.S. government could lead to tighter restrictions on its exports to China. The investor concerns overshadowed second-quarter earnings at Europe's largest technology company that beat forecasts and showed a rise in AI-linked bookings, as well as continued strong sales in China. Shares fell by more than 10% after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the U.S. is telling allies, including the Netherlands, it may take unilateral action to restrict exports of chip equipment to China if they fail to do so themselves. \"We don't comment on the rumours,\" said Christophe Fouquet in his first analyst call as CEO following the earnings. ASML is already restricted from selling most of its advanced product lines in China, and Fouquet added that the company also already faces restrictions on servicing existing equipment in some Chinese plants as a result of US and European rules. The Dutch foreign ministry said it could not comment on the report but was in close contact with allies on export controls, which it said were a matter of national security. Fouquet said ASML continued to view 2024 as a \"transition year\" with broadly flat performance as it prepares for a strong 2025. \"We currently see strong developments in AI, driving most of the industry recovery and growth, ahead of other market segments,\" Fouquet said. Net income of 1.6 billion euros ($1.74 billion) for the quarter ended June 30 was down 19% from a year earlier but beat the 1.41 billion expected by analysts, LSEG data showed. Revenue fell 9.5% to 6.2 billion euros but topped an analysts estimate of 6.04 billion. ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, complex tools that use lasers to help create the tiny circuitry of computer chips. Chinese chipmakers, facing escalating U.S.-led restrictions on ASML's top-end gear, have increased purchases of equipment used to make older generations of chips widely used in cars and industrial applications. China, usually ASML's third market after Taiwan and South Korea, accounted for more than 2 billion euros in lithography system sales in the second quarter, around 49% of the total. CFO Roger Dassen said about 20% of the company's current order backlog is for sales to China, and those tools would likely be sold elsewhere if not in China, given the world's growing demand for older chips. Analysts linked the fall in share price to the Bloomberg report and remarks Bloomberg published from a June interview with U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump in which he said Taiwan had taken \"100% of our chip business\". ASML's top customer is Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW)  , which makes chips for Nvidia (NVDA.O)   and Apple (AAPL.O)  . \"The geopolitical angle....is more likely to be in focus today than the results,\" Citi analysts wrote in a note. \"The arguments being referenced [in the Bloomberg report] are not new, but pressure is building\" for further restrictions they said. Shares in Europe's second-largest listed company behind pharmaceuticals maker Novo Nordisk fell 7.9% to 900.00 euros at 1236 GMT, pulling other European chip stocks lower. ASML's shares were up 28% in the year to date following Wednesday's decline. In the earnings report, new bookings increased to 5.6 billion euros from 3.6 billion euros in the first quarter, with about half of that coming from the its most advanced EUV product lines - vital to manufacturing AI and smartphone chips. Analysts had expected ASML's order book to increase to about 5 billion euros, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. \"EUV orders increased substantially\" in the quarter, Mihuzo Securities analyst Kevin Wang told Reuters. \"We attribute this to strong orders from TSMC and Intel.\" TSMC, Intel and Samsung are engaged in construction projects that will be outfitted with equipment in 2025-2027.

The head of technology development at Intel, (INTC.O)   Ann Kelleher, first mentioned the progress during a talk at the SPIE lithography conference on Tuesday in San Jose. ASML confirmed Kelleher's remarks were accurate. Lithography systems use focused light beams to help create the tiny circuitry of computer chips. ASML's High NA EUV tools, which are the size of a double decker bus and cost more than $350 million each, are expected to help enable new generations of smaller, faster chips. The first High NA tool in existence is at ASML's laboratory in Veldhoven, Netherlands and the second is under assembly at an Intel plant near Hillsboro, Oregon. Advanced chipmakers including TSMC and Samsung are expected to adopt the tool in the coming five years, with Intel saying at an event last week it intends to use the tool in production for its 14A generation of chips. In Kelleher's talk she said that the Veldhoven machine has seen the \"first light on wafer in resist,\" meaning the machine has been used in a test on a silicon wafer that has been treated with light-sensitive chemicals so that it is ready to receive a circuit pattern. An ASML spokesperson said the first light milestone had been reached \"very recently\"."

        "content": "HANOI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Communist-ruled Vietnam is expected to ratify this year the UN convention for the free establishment of trade unions, UN officials and diplomats said, in a move meant to cut risks of trade disputes but likely leaving some foreign companies uneasy. The long-delayed measure would be a major formal step in the tightly controlled one-party nation where the only existing national trade union operates within the Communist Party structure, although it is unclear how and when the convention, once ratified, would be actually applied. The Southeast Asian manufacturing hub, which is home to factories of international companies including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , Intel (INTC.O)  , Foxconn (2317.TW)   and Canon (7751.T)  , is highly reliant on commerce, which last year exceeded 160% of the $415 billion domestic economy. It is required to apply UN standards on workers' rights to avoid disputes over 'social dumping', which refers to the practice of countries competing unfairly with others over labour costs, under its multi-billion-dollar trade deals with the European Union and Pacific partners. \"We are confident Vietnam is committed to ratifying Convention 87 as early as possible,\" Ingrid Christensen, the head in Vietnam of the International Labour Organization, the UN agency responsible for labour rights, told Reuters. Convention 87 on the \"freedom of association and protection of the right to organise\" was adopted in 1948 and is one of the fundamental texts protecting labour rights worldwide. In a meeting in December with foreign experts, Vietnam's labour ministry officials said the ratification of the convention was expected in October 2024, according to a Hanoi-based diplomat. Other diplomats confirmed plans to ratify this year. The Vietnamese prime minister's office, the labour ministry and Vietnam General Confederation of Labour, the country's only national union, did not reply to requests for comment. After a decade of talks, parliament was expected to ratify the convention last year, just before the expiry of a January deadline agreed with Canada. With the deadline missed, Ottawa has in theory an additional argument to seek sanctions under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Canada, whose trade with Vietnam is worth over $10 billion, is reviewing a complaint about whether Vietnamese labour laws are in compliance with CPTPP's obligations on workers' rights, a Canadian government spokesperson said. The EU, which had bilateral trade with Hanoi amounting to nearly $65 billion in 2022, sees the ratification of Convention 87 and amendments of relevant laws as \"crucial\" to comply with the existing agreements, EU Ambassador to Vietnam Julien Guerrier said. However, \"if the ratification leads to more real power for trade unions, some companies may be unhappy,\" said Nguyen Hung, a specialist in supply chains at RMIT University Vietnam, warning that could impact foreign investment, including from Samsung, the largest investor in the country. Freedom of establishment would \"result in a disorderly proliferation of unions\" and deterioration of industrial relations, according to notes seen by Reuters for a 2016 speech by Samsung's former deputy head in Vietnam, Bang Hyun Woo. The notes said Bang's views did not reflect Samsung's. Samsung said in a statement it is committed to the ILO fundamental conventions and upholds \"the protection of our employees\u2019 labour and human rights as our guiding value\". Vietnam will raise by 6% the minimum wage in the business sector in July, following other hikes in the past. It will also increase from this year levies on large multinationals under a new global tax deal. Vivie Wei, who leads investment consultancy Dezan Shira & Associates in Vietnam, said she saw no significant impact on foreign investors' interest from enhanced unions rights or wage hikes. Vietnam \"does not position itself as the cheapest option\" but has still been able to attract investments even after recent increases in salaries, she said."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Monday most chips companies seeking government subsidies will get significantly less than they have sought, since the government received requests for more than double the $28 billion it plans to award. Raimondo said companies in leading edge chips manufacturing have requested more than $70 billion. She said the department is engaged in tough ongoing negotiations with individual companies. Raimondo said she was pushing leading edge chips companies \"to do more for less\" in order to fund more projects. She said her conversations with chips company CEOs typically include them asking for billions in government assistance, which she says is reasonable. \"I tell them you will be lucky to get half of that,\" Raimondo said. When they come in to finalize a deal, \"where they get less than half of what they wanted and they tell me they are not feeling lucky. That's the reality... We have to be tough with companies.\" Raimondo said the department is prioritizing projects that will be operational by 2030. \"We are saying no for now\" for projects to longer-range projects. Raimondo said the department now estimates the funding will ensure the U.S. produces 20% of the world's leading edge logic chips by 2030, up from zero today. She said more than 600 companies submitted statements of interest for funding but a \"significant majority\" will not receive funding including many worthy projects. The $52.7 billion Chips and Science program approved by Congress in August 2022 includes a $39 billion program to subsidize chip production and related supply chain investments, and the awards will help build factories and increase production. Earlier this month, Raimondo said Commerce would award a $1.5 billion grant to GlobalFoundries (GFS.O)  , the first major award. \"These are highly complex, first-of-their-kind facilities. The kind of facilities that TSMC (2330.TW)  , Samsung (005930.KS)  , Intel (INTC.O)   are proposing to do in the United States - these are new-generation investments - size, scale complexity that's never been done before in this country,\" Raimondo told Reuters this month. The awards can be a mix of grants, government loans and loan guarantees up to about 35% of project capital costs. Raimondo joked that because she was taking a hard line \"I am not on the Christmas card list of a lot these CEOs of these chips companies because we are squeezing every dollar.\""

        "content": "SEOUL, Feb 26 (Reuters) - South Korea announced on Monday a reform plan for listed companies to boost shareholder returns in an effort to reduce the \"Korea discount\" on stock prices, but the eagerly-awaited proposals fell short of market expectations. South Korea is using Japan's playbook to boost the value of its companies, analysts say, as its neighbour's stock market surged to a record high last week thanks to years of corporate governance reforms and other steps to encourage share buybacks, lower cross-holdings and increased dividends. Under the \"Corporate Value-up Programme\", the South Korean government will encourage and support companies' voluntary efforts to return more capital to shareholders and improve governance, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said. Companies will be able to refer to a detailed guideline set for release by the government in the first half of this year for their reporting plans, the FSC said. \"We expect it could help resolve the problem of 'Korea discount'\", the regulator said in a statement. The Korea discount refers to a tendency for South Korean companies to have lower valuations than global peers due to factors such as low dividend payouts, and the dominance of opaque conglomerates known as chaebols. Some analysts said the proposals didn't go far enough. \"The market was already expecting some 'sell-on-the-news' but profit-taking pressure turned out to be even heavier as the announced proposal was just too disappointing,\" said Huh Jae-hwan, an analyst at Eugene Investment Securities. \"It was just too plain, with few measures seen as incentives. Neither compulsory requirements nor tax benefits were in there, which were steps the market had been anticipating,\" he said. The benchmark KOSPI index fell as much as 1.42% in morning trade, with losses led by automakers and banks which are often considered undervalued. These sectors had rallied hard recently ahead of the government's reform proposal. To encourage voluntary reforms, the FSC is considering preferential treatment in tax policies for companies that enhance their market value and increase shareholder returns. The regulator will also introduce an index of firms with strong shareholder value. FSC Vice Chairman Kim So-young said at a press conference that the reforms must be voluntary, not compulsory, adding the proposal \"includes more and much stronger incentives than those rolled out in Japan.\" Kim said many companies are striving to improve their market value and more are expected to follow. Joining the government's push, South Korea's stock bourse said earlier this month it would establish a team dedicated to improving corporate governance while the national pension fund decided to invest in companies working to boost their value. The KOSPI rose 19% last year, underperforming the Nikkei (.N225) and the U.S. S&P500 (.SPX). In 2022, its performance beat only Russia among the Group of 20 big economies. About two-thirds of KOSPI-listed companies trade at a price-to-book value ratio (PBR) of less than 1, meaning their market value is less than the value of assets on the balance sheet. Global tech titan Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) was not doing much better, trading at a PBR of 1.2, compared with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)'s 5.2, according to LSEG data."

        "content": "SEOUL, Feb 23 (Reuters) - South Korea hopes to mirror Japan's efforts to boost the value of its companies as the neighbour's stock market surges to a record high, with measures Seoul hopes will narrow a \"Korea discount\" on stock prices. But while years of effort at pushing Japanese companies to be more responsive to shareholders have helped lift Tokyo shares above their 1989 \"bubble\"-era peak, the reforms floated last month by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol may not continue to boost the Seoul bourse, analysts say. The benchmark KOSPI index hit a more than 20-month high this week on optimism over the \"Corporate Value-up Programme\", to be announced on Monday, but some market participants are bracing for investors to take profits next week. They suspect gains may not continue beyond national elections in April. \"At this stage, we can't be sure how consequential the value-up programme will be for the corporate sector,\" Societe Generale analysts said. \"What we can say with greater confidence is that the probability of a re-rating has increased.\" The analysts cited two encouraging factors that could make this programme different from previous, failed reform efforts: the example of Japan and higher retail investor participation than the past. The reforms aim to unlock value in South Korean companies, which have underperformed their global peers largely due to poor decision making and weak governance by the country's opaque chaebol conglomerates. Yoon also wants to cheer domestic retail investors, who have been heavy sellers of Seoul shares. Signs of reform have accelerated purchases by foreign investors. Corporate reform is a major reason Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock average broke its 34-year-old record on Thursday, marking a 17% spike so far this year after surging 28% in 2023. Some analysts say Seoul's programme, the latest in a series of steps since late last year, could provide greater upside potential than in Japan, but they warn that reforms must have teeth to make a real impact. The measures will nudge listed companies with low valuations to report plans to boost corporate value, and will introduce an index of firms with strong shareholder value, the Financial Services Commission says. The government is considering tax incentives to encourage companies to return more to shareholders, the finance minister said last week. Also planned are individual savings accounts with tax breaks on dividend and interest income from local stocks. Some companies are responding. Hyundai Mobis, Samsung C&T, and SK Innovation are among firms announcing plans this year to cancel 3.4 trillion won ($2.6 billion) worth of company-held shares - boosting share value by reducing supply - compared with 4.9 trillion won for all of 2023. \"Valuations could be boosted by at least 25% if we assume Korean deep value sectors drift towards even half the valuations of their Taiwanese counterparts,\" HSBC analysts said in a note. Monday's measures will likely bolster confidence that South Korean reforms can be sustained, Morgan Stanley analysts said, but without follow-up the KOSPI will be kept \"range-bound but lean slightly to the downside due to some level of profit-taking, with the focus turning more to stocks that really matter on the reform drive\". The KOSPI rose 19% last year, underperforming the Nikkei and the U.S. S&P500. In 2022, its performance beat only Russia among the Group of 20 big economies. Domestic retail investors sold a net 13.8 trillion won ($10.4 billion) of local shares last year, their biggest sell-off in 11 years. So far this year, they have sold 5.1 trillion won, while their purchases of record high U.S. stocks have more than doubled from the same period last year and they have scooped up Japanese shares. Foreigners, by contrast, bought 11.3 trillion won of South Korean shares last year and have already added 10.2 trillion won so far in 2024 - 6.7 trillion won this month alone. To sustain the momentum, the authorities should consider requiring, not just encouraging, change, analysts say. Hurdles include high inheritance taxes and greater family ownership of companies than in Japan. \"The government has come up with a well-drawn blueprint. Now it needs to bring carrots and sticks that will really change the companies,\" said Han Ji-young, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities. ($1 = 1,326.4100 won)"

The new Xiaomi 14 Ultra phone, which expands on the company's partnership with German camera-maker Leica, includes a quad-camera configuration, while its more compact version, the Xiaomi 14, has a triple-camera configuration, Xiaomi said in a statement. The phones integrate large AI models into various applications, including a tool that enables real-time transcriptions from conferences, or another function allowing users to describe a photo for the AI to locate it in their gallery. Tech and telecom companies are releasing new products and features ahead of the annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona set to kick off Monday, hoping the buzz around AI will boost business prospects, though many experts say generative AI may raise legal or ethical concerns. Xiaomi last year was placed third globally for share of the smartphone market, accounting for 12.5% of global shipments, behind leader Apple (AAPL.O)   at 20.1% and Samsung (005930.KS)   in second with 19.4% market share, according to IDC. The company on Sunday also unveiled new wearable products, including the Xiaomi Smart Band 8 Pro, Xiaomi Watch S3, and Xiaomi Watch 2, which it says are suitable for sports, health and wellness activities."

Massachusetts-based OV Loop Inc filed the lawsuit in Boston federal court on Tuesday, seeking more than $75 million in damages under U.S. antitrust law from Mastercard for allegedly denying it access to an essential digital payments technology. OV Loop accused Mastercard of granting selective access to tokens that the lawsuit said are needed for a company to compete for digital wallet payments like those used for Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Wallet. \u201cWe are trying to do something that\u2019s super ambitious,\u201d OV Loop founder and chairman Will Graylin told Reuters on Thursday. Graylin, who previously helped launch Samsung Pay, said there was no business justification for Mastercard to deny what he called \u201cequal access.\u201d Mastercard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. OV Loop last year sued Mastercard in Manhattan federal court for allegedly infringing its patent rights in technology related to cloud-based card transactions. A judge in November paused the case amid related proceedings before a U.S. patent tribunal. Graylin said his company, founded in 2018, wants to develop and market a \u201csuper app\u201d for digital commerce. India\u2019s digital payments firm Paytm app is such an app, OV Loop said, offering services to consumers and merchants. The lawsuit said Graylin has personally invested more than $36 million into the 30-employee OV Loop and that the company\u2019s shareholders included Verizon Ventures and the venture capital firm Lightspeed Ventures. OV Loop alleged Mastercard\u2019s \u201cexclusionary conduct\u201d has caused it unspecified lost profits and business opportunities. \u201cMastercard has used its size, influence, power, and wealth to stifle emerging technology companies, such as OV Loop, that threaten its grip over payment processing networks,\u201d the lawsuit said. Visa has been \u201cmore open with us,\u201d than Mastercard, Graylin said. A representative for Visa did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its relationship with OV Loop. Visa is not a defendant in the lawsuit. The case is OV Loop Inc v. Mastercard Inc, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, No. 1:24-cv-10412.

The Dutch group's shares were 12% higher in midday trading, the third biggest gainer on the European benchmark STOXX 600 index (.STOXX), after it reported a 30% rise in quarterly orders driven by hybrid bonding, a form of chip packaging required for AI applications. Orders for the fourth quarter totalled 166 million euros ($180 million), part of which are expected to be shipped over the second and third quarters of 2024, the company said. Hybrid bonding orders nearly doubled, with around half of them for the group's most advanced systems. Besi's clients, who include Nvidia (NVDA.O) supplier TSMC (2330.TW), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS), have already been adopting its advanced chipmaking tools. Nvidia, the world's largest contract chipmaker, also posted upbeat results and forecast overnight, driving up shares of sector names including Tokyo Electron (8035.T), Aixtron (AIXGn.DE), Infineon (IFXGn.DE) ASML (ASML.AS) and ASM International (ASMI.AS). Besi's investors are also reacting to a positive update from Intel, Degroof Petercam analyst Michael Roeg said. The assembly equipment maker expects further growth in the hybrid bonding market and other advanced packaging technologies this year. In response the Amsterdam-based group is expanding its activities beyond China, with investments in Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam. This has also been driven by some customers moving their facilities out of China. Besi reported a gross profit margin of 65.1% for the fourth quarter, while its revenue rose nearly 30% from the previous quarter to 159.6 million euros. That exceeded its guidance for a gross margin of between 62% and 64% and quarter-on-quarter revenue growth of 15% to 25%. For the first quarter, Besi expects its revenue to drop 5% to 15% from the prior quarter, but sees a higher gross margin of between 64% and 66%, helped by advanced packaging products. \"The slope of the recovery this year is uncertain given restrained demand for mainstream applications and weakness in automotive end-user markets currently,\" CEO Richard Blickman said in a statement. He said industry analysts expect the market to rebound in 2024-2026, driven by recovery in mainstream assembly and Chinese markets, as well as additional capacity needs for AI logic and memory applications and advanced packaging.

The Sunnyvale, California-based company's shares were up more than 3% in extended trading. The outlook comes more than a month after Synopsys, the largest maker of software used in the chip designing process, said it would buy Ansys (ANSS.O)   in a $35 billion cash-and-stock deal. In an interview, Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi said the company has started filing for regulatory approvals and so far has encountered \"no surprises - there is nothing that we did not anticipate.\" Ghazi also told Reuters that the company hopes to tell investors whether it will sell off its software integrity business by March 20. Synopsys said in December it was evaluating strategic alternatives for the unit. Synopsys, which partners with chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)  , Intel (INTC.O)  , and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , expects second-quarter revenue to be in a range of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $1.55 billion, according to LSEG data. The AI boom has elevated demand for companies such as Synopsys, as its electronic design automation (EDA) tools are used by chip firms for custom semiconductor design in diverse sectors such as aerospace, automotive and industrial. Chip firms are spending heavily on research and design initiatives to make robust chips with innovative design, which is one of the industry's biggest challenges because billions of transistors - tiny on-off switches - must be precisely arranged on a piece of silicon just a few millimeters wide. That has sparked demand for software provided by Synopsys even as economic uncertainty looms. Synopsys forecast adjusted earnings per share in a range of $3.09 to $3.14 for the second quarter ending April 30, also above analysts' average estimate of $3.02 per share. The company reiterated its outlook for full-year revenue but raised its annual adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $13.47 to $13.55, from $13.33 to $13.41. Revenue in the first quarter ended Jan. 31 rose about 21% to $1.65 billion, in line with estimates. Excluding certain items, it earned $3.56 per share, beating the estimate of $3.43."

The research firm said U.S. smartphone sales last month were nearly half of the record levels seen in the same period in 2017, underscoring fears that the market may have peaked. \"Tough times in the volume-driven low-end coupled with delayed upgrades in anticipation of new products drove the market lower,\" said Maurice Klaehne, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Smartphone sales have waned after the pandemic-driven boom, as an uncertain economic outlook and lack of major new features led consumers to stick with their existing devices. Samsung has tried to drum up interest for its new Galaxy smartphones, which went on sale on Jan. 17, by offering multiple artificial intelligence (AI) functions including a two-way voice translation in real-time. Counterpoint said the S24 series has performed well in the U.S. market during the initial 1-2 weeks of launch, and that it could spark a rebound in smartphone sales in February. Apple (AAPL.O), meanwhile, continued to gain market share in the U.S. last month, thanks to promotional offers for its iPhone 15 series, and as cost-conscious consumers sought its older iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 devices, whose prices have come down. \"This combination is enabling Apple to maintain stability in a market experiencing double-digit declines,\" Counterpoint said."

The Meta CEO may also meet South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, the paper said. It would be his first known visit to South Korea since 2013. A presidential official confirmed that Zuckerberg had sought a meeting with Yoon, without providing further details. Samsung declined to comment."

        "content": "NEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walmart (WMT.N)   is trying to put itself further into Americans\u2019 homes. The $484 billion retailer is buying   Vizio (VZIO.N)  , a manufacturer of connected televisions, for $2.3 billion, less than 0.5% of the retailing giant\u2019s total value. In a world where companies from Amazon.com (AMZN.O)   to Meta Platforms (META.O)   are chasing the same ad dollars, the deal gives Walmart a new portal into the almighty U.S. consumer. But the massive retailer\u2019s abysmal M&A track record suggests the deal is still a waste. The company led by Doug McMillon said on Tuesday it planned to pay all cash for Vizio. The offer represents a 47% premium to Vizio\u2019s stock price before the Wall Street Journal reported its prospects on Feb. 13. Walmart didn\u2019t say that cost cuts were on the table. Instead, the story is all about culling more commercial spending. Vizio\u2019s hardware helps people connect to apps like Netflix (NFLX.O)   and Hulu, giving its new owner better visibility into habits of streaming watchers. Data, provided by Walmart, could in theory help advertisers fine tune decisions on commercials, making Walmart a more attractive place to park dollars. The deal is also a flyer on Vizio becoming a main artery to distribute content. As streaming services bundle together, monopolizing the delivery of shows \u2013 whether it\u2019s the TV unit or the wifi - becomes more important, too. Vizio, with over 10% of television sales market share, is the third largest, according to Parks Associates. The two largest companies, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and LG (003550.KS), would be off the table for Walmart to buy. The trouble is Walmart hasn\u2019t proven itself to be a very effective dealmaker, even when the transactions are small. The company snapped up khaki retailer Bonobos in 2017 for $310 million only to sell it six years later for $75 million to WHP Global and Express. The same fate befell vintage online store ModCloth. Even Jet.com, which Walmart acquired in $3.3 billion in 2016, was folded into its e-commerce unit. Plus regulators could still get in the way. Amazon was recently thwarted from buying vacuum maker iRobot (IRBT.O), a similarly tiny deal. Vizio might be Walmart\u2019s window to the world. As a deal, though, it could become the portal to nowhere. Follow @jennifersaba on X CONTEXT NEWS Walmart said on Feb. 20 it has agreed to acquire smart-TV maker Vizio for $2.3 billion in cash. The $484 billion retailer plans to plug Vizio hardware and its operating system into its growing advertising business to better target shoppers. The offer price of $11.50 per share represents a premium of 47% to Vizio\u2019s undisturbed stock price on Feb. 12 before the Wall Street Journal reported the deal\u2019s prospects. Walmart also reported fourth-quarter revenue rose 5.7% year-over-year to $173.4 billion. The company\u2019s advertising revenue increased 33%."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is awarding $1.5 billion to GlobalFoundries (GFS.O) to subsidize semiconductor production, the first major award from a $39 billion fund approved by Congress in 2022 to bolster domestic chip production. GlobalFoundries, the world's third-largest contract chipmaker, will build a new semiconductor production facility in Malta, New York, and expand existing operations there and in Burlington, Vermont, according to a preliminary agreement with the Commerce Department. The department in January announced a $162 million planned award to Microchip Technology and $35 million to a BAE Systems facility in New Hampshire in December. The $1.5 billion GlobalFoundries grant will be accompanied by $1.6 billion in available loans, with the funding expected to generate $12.5 billion in overall potential investment across the two states, the department said. \"The chips that GlobalFoundries will make in these new facilities are essential chips to our national security,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters Sunday. Raimondo told Reuters this month the agency is in active talks with numerous applicants and expects to make several announcements by the end of March. \"We're in the process of really complicated, challenging negotiations with these companies,\" Raimondo told Reuters. \"These are highly complex, first-of-their-kind facilities. The kind of facilities that TSMC (2330.TW), Samsung (005930.KS), Intel (INTC.O), are proposing to do in the United States -- these are new-generation investments -- size, scale complexity that's never been done before in this country.\" The GlobalFoundries chips are used in satellite and space communications and the defense industry along with blind spot detection and collision warnings in vehicles, along with Wi-Fi and cellular connections. \"As an industry, we now need to turn our attention to increasing the demand for U.S.-made chips, and to growing our talented U.S. semiconductor workforce,\" GlobalFoundries CEO Thomas Caulfield said in a statement. GlobalFoundries opened a $4 billion semiconductor fabrication plant in Singapore in September, as part of a major global manufacturing expansion. The Malta facility expansion will secure a stable supply of chips for auto suppliers and manufacturers, including General Motors (GM.N), Raimondo added. GlobalFoundries and GM on Feb. 9 announced a long-term deal for the automaker to secure U.S.-made processors that will help it avoid factory-halting chip shortages like ones during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"GlobalFoundries\u2019 investment in New York both ensures a robust supply of semiconductors in the U.S. to help GM meet demand and supports U.S. leadership in automotive innovation,\" said General Motors President Mark Reuss. The new facility in Malta will produce high-value chips that are not currently made anywhere in the United States, Raimondo added."

Negotiations are underway, and Intel's award package will likely include both loans and direct grants, according to the report. The U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the disbursement of CHIPS Act funds, and Intel declined to comment. The department has already announced two smaller Chips Act grants and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said earlier this month that her department planned to make several funding awards within two months from the government's $39 billion program to boost semiconductor manufacturing. The semiconductor fund is intended to subsidize chip production and related supply chain investments, and the awards will help build factories and increase production. Intel plans to spend tens of billions of dollars to fund chip factories at longtime sites in Arizona and New Mexico, along with a new site in Ohio that the Silicon Valley company says could become the world's largest chip plant. But the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Intel planned to delay completion of the Ohio site until 2026 due to a slowdown in the chip market and a slow rollout of federal dollars. It remains unclear whether a wave of federal dollars this year would speed those plans back up, or the plans of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW), which has also applied for U.S. funding and whose chip factory under construction in Arizona has been delayed. Micron (MU.O) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) are also constructing new chip factories in the U.S. and have applied to the program."

The outlook was also supported by improvement in certain electronics end-markets like smartphones and personal computers, and analysts highlighted a diversified portfolio that sets up the company for further gains. \"Applied is well-positioned to benefit from multiple upcoming technology inflections that should drive outperformance vs WFE (wafer fab equipment) over the next several years,\" said analysts at J.P. Morgan. Applied Materials forecast second-quarter revenue of $6.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and adjusted profit per share of $1.79 to $2.15 or the quarter ending April, above market expectations. It also topped expectation for first-quarter revenue. The company's stock was trading at 203.05 in afternoon trading. Including session gains, shares have gained about 24% year to date. \"Management noted recovery in utilization across leading edge logic and memory customers which increases our confidence in \"V\" shaped recovery,\" said analysts at Jefferies. Applied Materials, which supplies to Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) among others, expects high-bandwidth memory (HBM) packaging revenues to be four times larger than last year. HBM packaging uses a special stacking arrangement of memory chips for better performance and is suitable for high-performance computing. At least four analysts raised their ratings and eight bumped up their price targets, according to LSEG data. Currently, the stock is valued at 22.77 times its one-year forward earnings, compared with the industry average of 25.17."

Strong spending from cloud computing service providers and the rise of AI-embedded personal computers are driving demand for more advanced chips and by extension, for chip making equipment too. \"There is a reacceleration of capital investment by cloud companies, fab utilization is increasing across all device types and memory inventory levels are normalizing,\" CEO Gary Dickerson said in a conference call with analysts. The company reported first-quarter revenue of $6.71 billion, beating estimates, and said China sales of $3 billion accounted for 45% of total revenue, up from 17%, a year earlier. Applied Materials makes equipment that helps fabricate chips and counts Intel (INTC.O)   and Samsung (005930.KS)   among its customers. The California-based company said it expects second-quarter revenue of $6.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $5.92 billion, according to LSEG data. It also forecast adjusted profit per share of $1.79 to $2.15, above estimates of $1.79. Analysts believe the push for stronger domestic supply chains for chips are benefiting companies such as Applied Materials and rival Lam Research (LRCX.O)  . Governments across the world have been urging chipmakers to develop domestic production of semiconductors, to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan amid U.S.-Sino tensions. Late last year, Applied Materials was under a criminal investigation by the Justice Department for sending equipment to China's top chipmaker SMIC via South Korea without export licenses, sources had told Reuters. Excluding items, Applied Materials' adjusted profit for the quarter ended Jan. 28 stood at $2.13 per share, beating estimates of $1.91. Its gross margin jumped to 47.8% from 46.7% a year earlier."

        "content": "Feb 15 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   on Thursday urged a U.S. appeals court to reverse a decision allowing thousands of privacy claims to move forward against the company, in case that could help rein in or embolden mass consumer arbitrations. Samsung told the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that leaving the lower court's decision in place could force it to pay millions of dollars in arbitration processing fees, giving unfair leverage to the claimants and their lawyers. Samsung at the hearing also disputed that all of the consumers had arbitration agreements with the company. The arbitrations against Samsung contend its facial recognition software violated an Illinois state law that restricts the collection and use of biometric information such as facial scans and fingerprints. Samsung has called the claims \"frivolous.\" Samsung\u2019s attorney Shay Dvoretzky said at Thursday's hearing that the consumers have produced \u201czero evidence\u201d that any of them has an arbitration agreement with the company. The company also said it was not obligated to pay millions of dollars in arbitration fees. The consumers' attorney Deepak Gupta countered that the plaintiffs provided Samsung with relevant consumer information and the \"reality is they know who is a Samsung customer.\" Companies typically view arbitration as a fast and fair way for individual consumers to air their disputes outside of court. In a mass arbitration, consumer plaintiffs lawyers can press thousands of similar or identical claims at once. A federal trial judge last year ruled   that Samsung had made a business decision to mandate arbitration rather than litigation in its consumer agreements, even if \"the company may not have expected so many would seek arbitration against it.\" 7th Circuit Chief Judge Diane Sykes on Thursday asked whether the claimants could establish they were all parties to arbitration agreements with Samsung. \u201cYou have affidavits from all of these tens of thousands of plaintiffs, sworn statements that they are a party to an arbitration agreement?\u201d Sykes asked. Gupta told Sykes the plaintiffs would have put forward that evidence if Samsung had made an \"evidentiary objection\" in the lower court. Samsung wants to be able to \"raise questions about one or two people\" in order to cast doubt on thousands of claimants, Gupta said. The case is Paula Wallrich et al v. Samsung Electronics America et al, 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 23-2842.

        "content": "CHENNAI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - India's Redington (REDI.NS)   expects demand for personal computers to bounce back next financial year as customers are likely to warm up to new devices with artificial intelligence features, a top executive at the tech goods distributor said. Global PC sales are showing signs of recovery after inflation-hit customers delayed system upgrades for several quarters, results of chipmakers including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   and Intel (INTC.O)   showed. \"The advent of AI, PCs will also drive tech refresh,\" Redington's Singapore, India and South Asia (SISA) CEO Ramesh Natarajan told Reuters, adding that he sees its PC business posting a single-digit percentage growth in fiscal 2025 in the region after reporting declines in the last six quarters. AI-enabled PCs refer to machines that come with chips capable of running large-language models and apps powered by the technology directly on the device, instead of the cloud. \"Considering the replacement cycles for PCs have averaged around three to four years, we believe 2024 will be the year that will see some rebound,\" said Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Research. SISA revenue from Redington's end-point solutions unit, which distributes PCs and printers, fell 7% to 100.72 billion rupees ($1.21 billion) in the nine months ended Dec. 31. The segment, which accounts for about 15% of the group's total revenue, had gained during the pandemic when businesses and individuals spent heavily to set up home offices. But many are yet to upgrade. Natarajan also expects more growth in Redington's mobile phone business, which distributes smartphones from Apple, Google and others, as affluent Indians splurge on phones that cost more than 30,000 rupees ($361.30). The segment had seen a 61% revenue jump in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 in the SISA region. Redington has been sharpening its focus on its cloud services business to expand beyond gadget distribution, which brings in a bulk of its revenue."

SK Group also said it plans to secure 80 trillion won by 2026 to invest in artificial intelligence and semiconductors as well as fund shareholder returns, while streamlining its more than 175 subsidiaries. The sprawling conglomerate outlined the plans following a two-day strategy meeting, aiming to revive the group after SK Hynix, its main money maker, and the group's electric vehicle battery arm suffered heavy losses. SK Group said it sought to improve its competitiveness by focusing on its AI value chain, including high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, AI data centres and AI services such as personalised AI assistants. At a time of transition, a \"preemptive and fundamental change is necessary,\" SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won was quoted as saying in the statement During the meeting, the executives also agreed to take gradual steps to adjust the number of subsidiaries in the group to a \"manageable range\", without specifying the scale of the reduction. Local media had said SK Innovation (096770.KS)  , which owns the county's largest oil refiner and battery maker SK On, was expected to pursue a merger with profitable gas affiliate SK E&S. The group expects its profit before tax to reach around 22 trillion won this year, turning around from a loss last year, with the goal of hitting 40 trillion won in profit before tax by 2026. South Korea, home to the world's top memory chip makers Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   and SK Hynix, has fallen behind some rivals in areas such as chip design and contract chip manufacturing. Earlier this year, the government announced a 26 trillion won ($19 billion) support package for its chip businesses, citing a need to keep up in areas like chip design and contract manufacturing amid 'all-out warfare' in the global semiconductor market.

EU antitrust regulators will seek additional third-party views, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on Friday. The moves underscore the unease among regulators worldwide on Big Tech leveraging its dominance into the new technology, echoing the companies' market power in other sectors. Vestager in March sent questionnaires to Microsoft, Google, Meta's (META.O)   Facebook and ByteDance's TikTok as well as other big tech companies related to their AI partnerships. \"We have reviewed the replies, and are now sending a follow-up request for information on the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI. To understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors,\" she told a conference. Reuters was first to report that EU regulators were building a case that could lead to an investigation into the partnership between the two companies. \"We stand ready to respond to any additional questions the European Commission may have,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI will not be subject to EU merger rules because of the absence of control, Vestager said. While OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a 49% stake. Vestager also cited concerns about Big Tech blocking smaller AI developers from reaching users and businesses. \"We are also sending requests for information to better understand the effects of Google's arrangement with Samsung to pre-install its small model Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices,\" she said. Google in January reached a multi-year deal with the South Korean company to embed its generative artificial intelligence technology in Samsung's Galaxy S24 series smartphones. Vestager also said she was looking into \"acqui-hires,\" where one company acquires another mainly for its talent, as exemplified in Microsoft's $650-million acquisition of startup Inflection in March that allowed it to use Inflection's models and hire most of its staff. \"We will make sure these practices don't slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,\" she said."

The announcement is the latest in a string of Chips and Science grants as the U.S. seeks to expand domestic chip production and lure away capital that might have been used to build plants in China and the region. Big winners include South Korean's Samsung, U.S.-based Intel, and Taiwan's TSMC. Congress in 2022 approved the Chips and Science Act to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in research and manufacturing subsidies. Lawmakers also approved $75 billion in government loan authority. According to the Commerce Department, the project's first phase would support the production of liquid filter membranes and Front Opening Unified Pods (FOUPS), specialized containers invented by Entegris to secure semiconductor wafers when transported during the manufacturing process. Top chipmakers including Intel, TSMC, Micron, and GlobalFoundries are FOUP customers, the agency added. The second phase would support the production of advanced liquid filters, purifiers and fluid handling solutions, Commerce said. Sanctioned Chinese chip manufacturer SMIC has also been an important customer for Entegris. Reuters reported in February that the Commerce Department halted millions of dollars worth of shipments of chipmaking materials and parts from Entegris to SMIC's most advanced facility, after SMIC produced a sophisticated chip for Huawei's Mate 60 Pro phone. Reuters found no evidence that Entegris had violated any U.S. laws or regulations."

        "content": "SEOUL, June 26 (Reuters) - South Korean authorities ordered a halt on Wednesday to the operations of a manufacturer of lithium batteries after a fire killed 23 people, as they investigate three company officials for suspected safety violations. Monday's fire at unlisted battery maker Aricell was one of the deadliest industrial accidents of recent years. Dozens of South Korean workers lose their lives on the job each year, despite tougher laws and measures to improve safety. The company in the industrial hub of Hwaseong southwest of Seoul, the capital, was told to shut its only factory for inspection, Min Gil-soo, an official of the labour ministry, told a briefing. Police raided the company's offices on Wednesday, the Yonhap news agency said. Authorities did not identify the company officials being investigated, however. Safety code violations can lead to jail terms for fatal accidents. Aricell Chief Executive Park Soon-kwan apologised on Tuesday for the fire, but said the company had followed all safety regulations and training requirements. Flames quickly engulfed the factory, where 35,000 lithium batteries were stored, and the spread of toxic smoke probably rendered workers unconscious within seconds, fire officials have said. Only three of the dead, all of them South Korean men, have been identified. The rest, including 17 Chinese, have yet to be identified as their bodies suffered severe damage in the fire. Investigators are trying to determine the cause of the blaze amid questions about Aricell's hiring of foreign workers on a temporary basis and whether they received adequate safety training. The office of a lawmaker, Kim Sung-hoi, provided a copy of a March inspection report by the Hwaseong fire department that showed it had flagged serious risks, including possible \"rapid combustion\" at the building where the fire broke out. The fire department was not available for comment. Set up in 2020, Aricell has 48 full-time employees and makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It also supplies batteries to the military for use in some communication and crypto devices, a spokesperson for South Korea's defence procurement agency said. The agency's annual safety inspections cover suppliers in some categories, such as firearms and chemicals, but exclude battery makers such as Aricell, the spokesperson added. Its parent, S-Connect (096630.KQ)  , supplies lithium-ion battery parts to Samsung SDI (006400.KS)  , one of the country's major secondary battery makers."

        "content": "HWASEONG, South Korea, June 25 (Reuters) - The CEO of a South Korean lithium battery manufacturer apologised on Tuesday following a massive factory fire that killed 23 workers, but said the company had complied with all required safety precautions and training. The fire on Monday, which began at a factory with 35,000 lithium batteries, produced thick smoke that spread quickly and the workers inside the second-floor location likely lost consciousness and succumbed within seconds, fire officials said. Firefighters with search dogs combed the gutted structure on Tuesday in Hwaseong, an industrial cluster southwest of the capital Seoul, and found the last person who had been unaccounted for, raising the death toll to 23. Seventeen of those who died were Chinese, and one was Laotian. The rest were South Koreans. Most of them were temporary workers at the plant which is run by South Korea-based Aricell, majority-owned by S-Connect (096630.KQ). Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in South Korea are at risk from accidents like the factory fire, as they make up a large portion of the workforce but face a greater risk of injury or death. Aricell CEO Park Soon-kwan offered condolences to the workers who were killed and apologised to everyone who had been affected by the accident. \"We will be conscientiously taking part in the investigation by authorities and will do our best to determine the cause of the accident and to take measures to prevent a repeat of such an accident,\" Park told reporters at the scene of the fire. Officials from agencies including the National Forensic Service, police and the fire department entered the factory as part of a joint investigation. The fire was the latest industrial accident in a country where dozens of manufacturing workers lose their lives on the job each year despite repeated calls to improve workplace safety. \"I ask the ministries of labour and industry and the National Fire Agency to conduct an urgent safety inspection and, where there is concern of an accident, take immediate measures,\" Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said at a cabinet meeting. Park, the Aricell CEO, said the company had fully complied with safety procedures and training, but more than half of the 103 workers at the factory, including some of those killed, were contract workers dispatched by a manpower company. Established in 2020, Aricell makes lithium primary batteries for sensors and radio communication devices. It has 48 full-time employees, according to its latest regulatory filing and its LinkedIn profile. Its parent S-Connect supplies lithium-ion battery parts to Samsung SDI (006400.KS), one of the country's major secondary battery makers, according to S-Connect's website. Regulatory filings showed Aricell recorded a 2.6 billion won ($1.9 million) operating loss last year on 4.8 billion won revenue, and a 14% increase in accumulated debt to 23.8 billion won. It has recorded net losses every year since its founding. Shares of S-Connect, registered on the junior Kosdaq index, were trading 1.37% lower on Tuesday after plunging 22.5% on Monday following the news of the fire. A labour ministry official told Reuters it was investigating whether Aricell complied with safety regulations and gave adequate safety training for temporary foreign workers. Violations of those regulations are subject to criminal prosecution, the official said, requesting anonymity. When the fire started, sparks burst and white smoke rose, followed by several explosions from piles of batteries, according to a video footage of the inside of the factory, shown on local media. The workers tried to contain the flame with extinguishers but failed, and the factory room was soon engulfed in smoke, the video showed. Reuters could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video. Many of the bodies remain unidentified. Reuters journalists saw some wailing family members trying to enter the site, which had been cordoned off. ($1 = 1,386.2000 won)"

        "content": "SEOUL, June 25 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Group (034730.KS)   plans to hold a two-day strategy meeting starting Friday to discuss streamlining its business to focus on key areas including artificial intelligence, chips and batteries. The group, best known for its chip firm SK Hynix (000660.KS)  , has become bloated over the past decade and its electric vehicle battery unit has lost billions of dollars. Here is what's known about the expected restructuring: South Korea's second-largest conglomerate encompassed 219 companies as of May, the most among the country's 88 business groups, according to the Korea Fair Trade Commission. By contrast, Samsung Group, the biggest conglomerate by assets, has 63 firms and Hyundai Motor Group has 70. The SK conglomerate has been thinking about a revamp since four senior executives stepped down late last year. Its main money maker, SK Hynix, also suffered heavy losses last year, stretching the conglomerate's finances. The meeting, which will include executives from the parent company and affiliate firms, will look at options from mergers to divestments, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. A SK Group spokesperson described the conglomerate's review of its businesses as a \"routine management activity\" to help it better respond to \"a changing business environment, including geopolitical issues.\" SK Innovation (096770.KS)  , which owns the country's largest oil refiner and battery maker SK On, is expected to pursue a merger with profitable gas affiliate SK E&S to help prop up SK On, local media outlets have reported. SK Innovation has said it is considering various strategic measures including mergers to strengthen its competitiveness, but nothing has been decided. SK On has never made a profit since it was split off from SK Innovation in late 2021. Its cumulative operating losses amount to about 2.3 trillion won ($1.7 billion) while its debt-to-equity ratio was 188% as of end-March. But the conglomerate sees batteries as a long-term growth area and is trying to cut back investments in other units so it can better support SK On, analysts say. The conglomerate may also merge builder SK EcoPlant and SK Materials' industrial gas unit, the Korea Economic Daily reported on Sunday, citing unidentified industry sources. SK EcoPlant and SK Materials said they were not aware of such discussions. SK Networks (001740.KS)  , which sells smartphones and manages hotels, said last week it would sell its car rental unit to private equity firm Affinity Equity Partners for 820 billion won ($590 million). The group is also in talks to sell its 9% stake in Vietnam's Masan Group back to the retail-to-telecoms conglomerate, an SK spokesperson said. ($1 = 1,390.0900 won)"

        "content": "June 21 - Dallas-based law firm McKool Smith, known for taking on high-stakes patent cases and other litigation, said it will pay its associates and other lawyers mid-year bonuses up to $30,000. Bonuses for McKool Smith principals, associates and senior counsel will range from $2,500 to $30,000 depending on their pace of billing, David Sochia, the 130-litigator firm's managing principal and chairman, said in an internal memo on Thursday. \u201cWe know it\u2019s been a busy 2024 and want to show our appreciation for your contribution to the firm\u2019s continued success and the success of our clients,\u201d Sochia said in the memo, which was viewed by Reuters. Sochia was not immediately available for additional comment. The memo said lawyers would receive their bonuses, which do not supplant potential year-end bonuses, by June 30. Many U.S. law firms, including large full-service corporate and litigation firms, doled out mid-year or other \"special\" discretionary bonus payouts in 2021, amid an M&A boom and intense competition for associate talent. Law firms have traditionally dispensed only year-end bonuses. Litigation has been a relative bright spot for law firms as mergers and acquisitions and other corporate deal work waned after pandemic-era highs. It helped drive an overall growth in demand for law firm services at the beginning of 2024 after a lackluster 2023, according to Thomson Reuters Institute\u2019s Law Firm Financial Index. Another litigation firm, 75-lawyer Hueston Hennigan, said last week that it would hand out bonuses ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 to associates and counsel who meet certain billable hour marks, according to media reports. The California-founded firm declined to comment. McKool Smith's recent litigation wins have included a $445 million patent infringement jury verdict for computer memory company Netlist against chipmaker Micron Technology in May, and a $142 million patent damages jury verdict for G+ Communications against Samsung in April. McKool Smith had co-counsel from litigation firm Irell & Manella in those cases."

        "content": "MUMBAI, June 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - If Hyundai Motor's (005380.KS)   up to $3 billion initial public offering of its Indian business crystallises a premium valuation as easily as expected, other multinationals could rush to list their local operations in the South Asian nation. The South Korean carmaker on Saturday filed for a listing of the unit in Mumbai. The target valuation of up to $30 billion, per Reuters citing unnamed sources, is 53 times its earnings in the 12 months ended March 2023, compared to 32 times for its larger rival Maruti Suzuki (MRTI.NS)   and five times for its $48 billion Seoul-listed parent. An IPO offers lots of benefits. It will crush   the \"Korean discount\", where companies trading in Seoul are plagued by lower valuations than Asian peers because opaque conglomerates dominate the market. Hyundai also can use the new richly valued shares to strike deals in India, where it wants to sell more expensive cars and increase its share of electric vehicles. A listing outside Seoul offers some protection from any future funding squeeze at home. The default of a Legoland theme park developer, for example, caught large Korean companies off-guard in 2022 and pushed up borrowing costs. The carmaker is the latest global company tapping aspects of what Marc Bitzer, CEO of U.S. appliance maker Whirlpool  (WHR.N)   describes as \"asset arbitrage\"; the company sold a 24% stake in its India unit in February. Similarly British American Tobacco (BATS.L)   in March sold a 3.5% stake in its Indian peer ITC (ITC.NS)   and used the $2 billion proceeds to support a $895 million share buyback. Companies usually shy away from floating their subsidiaries because it is not efficient to manage multiple listings. The local listings of Unilever (ULVR.L)  , Nestle (NESN.S)  , Pfizer (PFE.N)  , Siemens (SIEGn.DE)   and Suzuki Motor (7269.T)   enjoy big premiums but many are legacy structures. The difficulty of taking a company private in India is another reason to hold back. Yet India's increasing importance as a growth market and its buoyant stocks may be changing the balance of the equation. The case is strong for Japanese companies that are under pressure   to boost shareholder value. Take Honda Motor Co (7267.T)  , which counts the South Asian country as its top   market for motorcycles. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T)   could consider listing its Indian shadow bank which is growing 24%   year-on-year. Other foreign firms with large India businesses include Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  . Hyundai's deal is barely out of the door but bankers are salivating over the prospect of more just like it. Follow @ShritamaBose   on X CONTEXT NEWS Hyundai Motor's Indian unit on June 15 filed for a Mumbai initial public offering, Reuters reported the same day citing the draft prospectus. The company plans to sell up to a 17.5% stake held by its South Korean parent. No new shares will be issued. The deal will generate proceeds of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for the seller at a valuation of up to $30 billion, sources told Reuters. Citi, JPMorgan, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and India's Kotak Mahindra Capital are advising the company on the deal. Hyundai shares rose nearly 5% before midday in Seoul on June 17."

AlmondNet attorneys Reza Mirzaie and Marc Fenster of Russ August & Kabat called the verdict a \"validating win\" for AlmondNet's CEO, inventor Roy Shkedi, and the \"foundational technology he invented.\" Mirzaie said that with interest, the total amount of the award will likely approach $200 million. An Amazon attorney and company spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the verdict. Long Island City, New York-based AlmondNet sued Amazon in 2021, accusing the e-commerce giant of infringing patents covering \"privacy-friendly, targeted advertising\" technology that AlmondNet said it pioneered. AlmondNet said Amazon features including its ad exchange and stand-alone targeting services violated the patents and requested an unspecified amount of monetary damages. Amazon had denied the allegations and argued that the patents were invalid.

The NSE Nifty 50 (.NSEI) settled 0.33% higher at 23,398.90, recording an all-time closing high for the third time in four sessions. The S&P BSE Sensex (.BSESN) added 0.27% to finish at an all-time high of 76,810.90. Both the benchmarks climbed 0.7% in early trade to hit record highs before trimming some gains, in part as state-run banks (.NIFTYPSU) snapped a six-session post-elections results rally. U.S. consumer prices were unexpectedly unchanged in May, lifting bets of a rate cut in September to 61% from 53%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. \"Favourable cues from the U.S., including cooling core inflation, has boosted sentiment, powering IT stocks higher,\" said Sanjeev Hota, vice president and head of research at Sharekhan. Even the broader, domestically focussed small- (.NIFSMCP100) and mid- (.NIFMDCP100) hit all-time highs, joining in the global rally. That was despite the Fed slashing its forecast to only one rate cut worth 25 basis points this year, from the three it projected in March. The futures market, though, is pricing in 44 bps of cuts. Seven of the 13 major sectors logged gains. IT companies (.NIFTYIT), which count U.S. as a key revenue geography, jumped 1.03%. Financials (.NIFTYFIN) and realty (.NIFTYREAL) stocks, which are sensitive to domestic interest rates, climbed 0.29% and 2.24%, respectively. That was after data showed India's retail inflation eased slightly in May, supporting bets for a rate cut in the last quarter of the year. Among stocks, Larsen & Toubro (LART.NS) gained 2% after its hydrocarbon unit won an order for modifications at the Tapti Daman block, off India's west coast, from ONGC (ONGC.NS).

Samsung has lost ground compared to competitors in chips, especially high-end memory for AI, and its newly appointed head of its semiconductor division has called on staff to pull together to overcome a raft of challenges. Amazon is a key Samsung client for chips and the two firms also work together in various fields such as TV, mobile and content. Samsung's high-end smartphones use Qualcomm's Snapdragon mobile processors, and the companies have recently expanded their partnership to AI-enabled PCs. Meta is also a Samsung chip client and it has worked with Samsung on the South Korean firm's Gear VR headset and foldable smartphones."

        "content": "SEOUL/SAN JOSE, June 12 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   said its contract manufacturing business plans to offer a one-stop shop for clients to get their AI chips made faster, integrating its global No. 1 memory chip, foundry, and chip packaging services, to harness the AI boom. With clients working with a single channel of communication that directs Samsung's memory chip, foundry and chip packaging teams at once, the time it takes to produce AI chips - usually weeks - has been cut by around 20%, Samsung said on Wednesday. \"We are truly living in the age of AI - the emergence of generative AI is completely changing the technology landscape,\" said Siyoung Choi, President and General Manager, Foundry Business, at a Samsung event in San Jose, California. Samsung expects global chip industry revenue to grow to $778 billion by 2028, boosted by AI chips, Choi said. At a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, Executive Vice President of Foundry Sales and Marketing Marco Chisari said the company believes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's loose projections on soaring demand for AI chips are realistic. Altman has told executives at contract chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW)   he wanted to build roughly three dozen new chip factories, Reuters has previously reported. Samsung is one of the few companies that sells memory chips, offers foundry services and designs chips under the same roof. That combination has often worked against it in the past, as some clients were nervous that doing business with its foundry might benefit Samsung as a competitor in another field. However, with skyrocketing demand for AI chips and the need for all the chip parts to be highly integrated to train or infer huge amounts of data fast by using less power, Samsung believes its turnkey approach will be a strength going forward. The South Korean tech giant also touted its cutting-edge chip architecture known as gate all-around (GAA), a type of transistor architecture that helps improve chip performance and reduces power consumption. GAA is seen as important to keep making more powerful chips for AI as chips become finer to the point of pushing the boundaries of physics. Although competitors such as global foundry No. 1 TSMC are also working on chips using GAA, Samsung started applying GAA earlier, and said it plans to mass produce its second-generation 3-nanometre chips using GAA in the second half of this year. Samsung also announced its latest 2-nanometre chipmaking process for high-performance computing chips, which places power rails on the backside of the wafer to improve power delivery. Mass production is slated for 2027."

        "content": "June 11 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is considering further restrictions on China's access to chip technology used for artificial intelligence, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The measures being discussed would limit China's ability to use a cutting-edge chip architecture known as gate all-around, or GAA, the report said. GAA is a type of transistor architecture that helps improve chip performance and reduces power consumption. The United States has been working to limit Beijing's access to advanced AI chips, such as those designed by leader Nvidia (NVDA.O), through tightened trade restrictions amid fears that China may use the technology to bolster its military. With the scope of the potential rule still being determined, it is not clear when officials will make a final decision, the report said. \"The new controls are part of an effort by allied countries to each impose separately controls they had agreed to several years ago during Wassenaar Arrangement multilateral regime meetings but that were not ultimately approved because Russia blocked the consensus-based regime from publishing the controls,\" said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce official. Wolf noted that in March, the UK imposed controls over technology for integrated circuits with \"Gate all-around Field-Effect Transistor\" (GAAFET) structures, which are generally for advanced node integrated circuits. \"The U.S. and other allies are thus expected to impose this GAAFET and many other earlier-agreed-upon controls this summer,\" Wolf said. The rule is not yet finalized after industry officials criticized the first version as overly broad, the report said, adding that it is unclear whether the ban would restrict China's ability to develop its own GAA chips or seek to block U.S. chipmakers and other overseas companies from selling their products to Chinese firms. Leading semiconductor firms including Nvidia, Intel (INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), along with chip manufacturers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2330.TW) and Samsung (005930.KS) are aiming to start mass production of chips with the GAA design within the next year, according to the report. Nvidia and Intel declined to comment. The other companies did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment, while the U.S. Department of Commerce declined to comment. Stricter restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductors to China have already hampered chipmakers' position, with companies such as Intel and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) saying their sales would take a hit after the U.S. revoked some of their export licenses for a customer in China. The Bloomberg report also said there have been some early-stage discussions about limiting exports of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. HBM chips, such as those made by South Korea's SK Hynix (000660.KS) and Micron Technology (MU.O), help speed up AI applications and are used by companies like Nvidia."

        "content": "HANOI/HOA BINH, Vietnam, June 11 (Reuters) - Lights are off and air conditioning is down at the headquarters of Vietnam's state-run electricity provider EVN as the country's top power utility tries to \"lead by example\" to avoid a repeat of last year's crippling blackouts, an official tells visitors. But many businesses around Vietnam's capital Hanoi appear to be ignoring the call to conserve power, keeping decorative but otherwise purposeless neon lights on the outside of high-rise buildings on all night. The difficulties in curtailing consumption illustrate the challenges facing Vietnam a year after sudden outages caused losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to multinational manufacturers with investments in the Southeast Asian country. Vietnam is pursuing a patchwork agenda of energy-saving measures, grid upgrades, regulatory reforms and a massive increase of coal power as it seeks to avert electricity shortfalls, according to government data and interviews with officials and experts. But Trinh Mai Phuong, EVN's communications director, explains during a media visit that even the biggest infrastructure upgrade underway, a new $1 billion transmission line connecting the centre of the country to the highly industrialised north that was hard hit by blackouts last year, may not be enough. \"I would not say it is a game changer,\" Phuong said of the line that could be completed as early as this month, noting it is one of many measures needed amid multiple issues to address. Power consumption for instance is expected to hit record highs in the coming weeks as the country braces for more heatwaves, he said. The soaring power demand is making it increasingly difficult for Vietnam to meet climate change commitments while providing enough power to satisfy large investors such as Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , Foxconn (2354.TW)   and Canon (7751.T)  . Broader sector-wide reforms are needed over the longer term, foreign investors and analysts said. In the short term, Vietnam is banking mostly on coal to provide enough reliable electricity. It may be just enough - or not - but either way it may signal a blow to the country's commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Coal use rose massively in the first five months of 2024, with coal-fired power plants accounting on average for 59% of electricity output, exceeding 70% some days, according to EVN data. That was up from nearly 45% in the same period last year and 41% in 2021, when Vietnam began drafting plans to cut coal that persuaded international donors to commit $15.5 billion to help phase out the fuel. Thanks to a new coal-fired power plant that came online in 2023, coal accounted for 33% of total installed capacity last year, up from 30.8% in 2020, taking Vietnam further away from the goal of lowering that to 20% by 2030. Energy conservation is another key pillar of the plan. EVN and its local units have encouraged energy-hungry clients, including foreign manufacturers, to save power with tailored measures, especially in peak hours. But that risks Vietnam's reputation as a reliable place for investment and could affect future manufacturing expansion plans, according to foreign investors who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. The matter should be addressed by solving generation and distribution issues, and not from the consumption side, two foreign investors said. Vietnam's industry ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Vietnam is using only a fraction of its installed solar and onshore wind capacity due largely to administrative hurdles. It has not approved regulations to kick-start offshore wind projects and delays dog projects to build power plants fuelled by imported liquefied natural gas, which is cleaner than coal. The four energy sources together should account for more than 40% of installed capacity by 2030, according to the government's plans, though analysts are sceptical. Hydropower is projected to fall to less than 20% of installed power generation by the end of decade from more than 30% in 2020. But some capacity is being added in the north where needs are higher. One of Vietnam's largest hydropower plants at Hoa Binh is adding two General Electric (GE.N)   turbines to its existing eight, which will boost its total capacity to 2.4 gigawatts from less than 2 GW now by the second half of 2025, said Dao Trong Sang, EVN's manager of the expansion project, during a visit to the dam. The Hoa Binh plant, combined with the new transmission line that brings electricity to the north from separate plants, may add 8% capacity to the power-hungry north. The power crisis cannot be solved without long-awaited reforms, experts say, though progress to date has been slow. In April, the industry ministry issued an updated methodology for determining electricity prices, a step towards possibly reviving projects stuck for years because of a lack of clarity about tariffs. However, the methodology could force developers to shoulder excessive risk, complicating their access to finance, said a Vietnam-based official who declined to be named because they were not authorised to talk to media. A separate draft decree enabling manufacturers to buy electricity directly from producers is seen as close to approval after years of internal debate, according to several analysts. The use of direct power purchase agreements (DPPAs) could make it easier for multinational companies to avoid higher tariffs on exports and boost the use of renewables to help them meet environmental, social and governance requirements. But the DPPA rules need to be combined with other reforms, such as clearer provisions to directly connect factories to power-generation projects, the official said."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it planned to award Rocket Lab (RKLB.O)   $23.9 million to dramatically boost the production of compound semiconductors used in satellites and spacecraft. The award for Rocket Lab unit SolAero Technologies Corp \"would help create a more robust and resilient supply of space-grade solar cells that power spacecrafts and satellites\", the department said, adding it would \"increase Rocket Lab's compound semiconductor production by 50% within the next three years.\" The funds are to come from the Biden administration's $52.7 billion chip manufacturing and research subsidy program that has benefited companies like South Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , Intel (INTC.O)   and Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW)  . Separately, the State of New Mexico has committed to providing financial assistance and incentives worth $25.5 million to Rocket Lab as the company works on the expansion of its facility in Albuquerque. Rocket Lab, founded in 2006 by New Zealander Peter Beck, is one of two U.S. firms specializing in the production of highly efficient, radiation resistant compound semiconductors called space-grade solar cells, the department said. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said solar cells were crucial for keeping communication and space technology powered and operational, and the proposed $23.9 million award would help Rocket Lab expand production facilities to meet growing demand for chips from the U.S. military, NASA and the commercial space industry. The company's solar cells support U.S. space programs, including missile awareness systems, the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA's Artemis lunar explorations, Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, and Mars Insight Lander. Rocket Lab has won several hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. federal contracts, including for satellite production, the launch of spacecrafts and a deal to explore delivering cargo using its rockets. The latest award, like others from the chips subsidy program, have yet to be finalized and amounts could change after the Commerce Department conducts due diligence. The proposed investment would also benefit Rocket Lab's Albuquerque facility expansion and create more than 100 manufacturing jobs, the company said in a statement. Rocket Lab also plans to claim the Department of the Treasury's investment tax credit of up to 25% of qualified capital expenditures. The investment tax credit created by the Chips Act is estimated to be worth about $24 billion."

        "content": "TAIPEI, June 10 (Reuters) - A two-year legal battle pitting two tech titans threatens to disrupt an emerging wave of new personal computers powered by artificial intelligence, tech industry executives and experts say. A parade of executives from Microsoft (MSFT.O)  , Asus (2357.TW)  , Acer (2353.TW)   and others joined Qualcomm (QCOM.O)   CEO Cristiano Amon on stage last week at the annual Computex trade show in Taipei to pitch a new generation of AI-powered PCs. But the main conversation among conference attendees was over how a contract dispute between Arm Holdings and Qualcomm, which work together to make the chips powering these new laptops, could abruptly halt the shipment of new PCs that industry leaders expect will make Microsoft and its partners billions of dollars. Rough projections suggest Microsoft expects to take roughly 5% of the market with the Arm-based laptops by the end of the year, selling about 1 million to 2 million units. Nearly two dozen models ranging from Microsoft, Dell (DELL.N)   and Samsung (005930.KS)   are expected to ship to consumers June 18. An Arm victory in the litigation could force Qualcomm and its roughly 20 partners, including Microsoft, to halt shipments of the new laptops. \"It's definitely a real risk,\" said Doug O'Laughlin, the founder of chip financial analysis firm Fabricated Knowledge. \"The more successful (the laptops are), the more fees Arm can get eventually.\" The British company, which is majority-owned by Japan's SoftBank Group (9984.T)  , sued Qualcomm in 2022 for failing to negotiate a new license after it acquired a new company. The suit revolves around technology that Qualcomm, a designer of mobile chips, acquired from a business called Nuvia that was founded by Apple chip engineers and which it purchased in 2021 for $1.4 billion. Arm builds the intellectual property and designs that it sells to companies such as Apple (AAPL.O)   and Qualcomm, which they use to make chips. Nuvia had plans to design server chips based on Arm licenses, but after the acquisition closed, Qualcomm reassigned its remaining team to develop a laptop processor, which is now being used in Microsoft's latest AI PC, called Copilot+. Arm said the current design planned for Microsoft's Copilot+ laptops is a direct technical descendant of Nuvia's chip. Arm said it had cancelled the license for these chips. \"Arm's claim against Qualcomm and Nuvia is about protecting the Arm ecosystem and partners who rely on our IP and innovative designs, and therefore enforcing Qualcomm's contractual obligation to destroy and stop using the Nuvia designs that were derived from Arm technology,\" an Arm spokesperson said. Qualcomm has said that its broad license for Arm technology already covers its PC chips, and a Qualcomm spokesperson said its position has not changed since Arm filed the suit in 2022. \"Arm's complaint ignores the fact that Qualcomm has broad, well-established license rights covering its custom-designed CPUs, and we are confident those rights will be affirmed,\" Ann Chaplin, Qualcomm's general counsel, said in a 2022 statement. On top of this legal dispute is another level of complexity because the exclusive deal to supply laptop builders with its chips expires this year, opening up the market to Qualcomm's competitors. Nvidia (NVDA.O)   and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O)   are working on chips, Reuters reported last year. And other design companies will join the fray and make chips for Microsoft's new effort, industry executives have said. Yet, because the initial batch of Windows designs for Microsoft's new Copilot+ laptop program are based on Qualcomm's processors, the litigation is an undercurrent that exists but often goes unmentioned in public. Despite the public fight between two companies that rely on each other for revenue and profit, some investors and analysts believe they will reach a settlement well ahead of the trial, which is scheduled to begin in the federal court in Delaware in December. \"There is a degree of absurdity of Arm suing its second-biggest customer, and Qualcomm being sued by its largest supplier,\" said Jay Goldberg, the CEO chief of D2D Advisory, a finance and strategy consulting firm."

        "content": "European governments may be wary of budget Chinese electric vehicles flooding their markets but they're also fiercely competing for a share of the manufacturing investment and jobs the new competitors bring. While the European Union investigates China's auto subsidies and considers tariffs on imports, national governments across the bloc are dangling their own incentives to attract Chinese automakers looking to build European factories. Manufacturing costs for Chinese EV makers including BYD (002594.SZ)  , Chery Automobile (CHERY.UL) and state-owned SAIC Motor are much lower at home but they are nonetheless keen to set up in Europe to build their brands and save on shipping and potential tariffs, said Gianluca Di Loreto, a partner at consultancy firm Bain & Company. \"Chinese automakers know their cars must be perceived as European if they want to bear interest among European customers,\" he said. \"This means producing in Europe.\" The EU tariff decision is expected this week. On one hand, import taxes could help European automakers better compete with their Chinese counterparts, but they may also spur on Chinese automakers which are already investing heavily, and for the long-term, in Europe. Sales of Chinese-brand cars comprised 4% of the European market last year and are forecast to hit 7% by 2028, according to consulting firm AlixPartners. Hungary, which produced around 500,000 vehicles in 2023, secured the first European-factory investment by a Chinese automaker, announced last year by EV giant BYD which is also considering a second European plant in 2025. Budapest is also negotiating with Great Wall Motor (601633.SS)   for its first European plant, local media have reported, with the country offering cash for jobs creation, tax breaks and relaxed regulation in targeted zones to attract foreign investment. Hungary has spent more than $1 billion in recent years to support new battery plants of South Korean groups SK On and Samsung SDI (006400.KS)   and Chinese battery giant CATL's (300750.SZ)   planned factory. Representatives of BYD, Great Wall and Hungary did not respond to requests for comment. China's Leapmotor (9863.HK)   will use existing capacity of Franco-Italian partner Stellantis (STLAM.MI)  , with Reuters reporting the pair have chosen the Tychy plant in Poland as a manufacturing base. Poland has a number of programmes currently supporting more than $10 billion of investments, the country's development and technology ministry told Reuters, including one favouring the transition to a net-zero economy and another offering corporate income tax relief, of as much as 50% in high-unemployment regions. Spain, Europe's second largest car-making country after Germany, has secured investment from Chery, which will start production in the fourth quarter at a former Nissan facility in Barcelona with a local partner. Chery is expected to benefit from Spain's 3.7 billion-euro programme launched in 2020 to attract electric-vehicle and battery plants. China's Envision Group has already received 300 million euros in incentives under the scheme for a 2.5 billion battery plant creating 3,000 jobs. Spain might also host Stellantis' planned fourth gigafactory in Europe, with CATL. Chery plans a second, larger facility in Europe, a source with knowledge of the company's plans told Reuters, and has held talks with governments including Rome, which is keen to attract a second automaker to rival Fiat-maker Stellantis. Italy can tap its national automotive fund, worth 6 billion euros between 2025-2030, for incentives for both car buyers and manufacturers. China's Dongfeng (0489.HK)   is among several other automakers that have held investment discussions with Rome. Italy's industry ministry declined to comment. Dongfeng and Chery did not respond to requests for comment. SAIC, owner of the venerable MG brand, aims to build two Europe plants, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The first, based at an existing facility, could be announced as early as July and would employ a kit-assembly technique, targeting annual production of up to 50,000 vehicles, one of the sources said. SAIC's second European plant would be built from scratch and produce up to 200,000 vehicles annually, the source added. Germany, Italy, Spain and Hungary were on SAIC's location shortlist, the source said. SAIC did not respond to a request for comment. In Europe, Chinese automakers face higher costs for everything from labour to energy to regulatory compliance. But costs for exporting made-in-China cars can add up quickly and threaten already narrow margins. Bain & Company's Di Loreto said a 15,000-euro car produced in China requires shipping-and-logistics costs of between 500 and 3,000 euros. Chinese automakers may find labour costs in Northern Europe too high for competitive production, Di Loreto said, whereas further south, Italy or Spain offer a balance of lower labour costs and relatively high manufacturing standards - particularly important for premium vehicles. For lower-cost vehicles, Di Loreto said, attractive locations include Eastern Europe and Turkey, which currently produces around 1.5 million cars annually, mostly for the EU, and has held talks with BYD, Chery, SAIC and Great Wall. Turkey's customs union with the EU and free trade deals with non-EU countries guarantee tariff-free vehicle and component exports."

        "content": "SEOUL, June 7 (Reuters) - A workers' union at Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   staged its first walkout on Friday, signalling more assertiveness among employees just as South Korea's most powerful conglomerate races to catch up in chips used in artificial intelligence. The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), whose roughly 28,000 members make up over a fifth of the firm's workforce, said it would stop work for a day to demand better pay. The walkout is unlikely to immediately impact semiconductor production or shipments but will add pressure on Samsung Electronics as it chases AI and narrows a gap in contract chip manufacturing with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW)  , analysts said. \"The purpose of today's strike action is to have meaningful conversation with management,\" NSEU official Lee Hyun-kuk told Reuters. He said the union was preparing further action on Friday, without providing details. Samsung Electronics said there was no impact on production or business activity. The strike fell a day after a public holiday and there were fewer employees on annual leave than on the equivalent day last year, the firm said. The union did not disclose how many members participated in the strike through annual leave. \"We have sincerely engaged with the union and will continue talks with them,\" said a company official. Samsung Electronics' share price closed down 0.1%, versus a 1.2% rise in the benchmark KOSPI (.KS11)  . The walkout is unlikely to impact DRAM or NAND flash memory production or lead to shipment shortages as manufacturing is highly automated, said market researcher TrendForce. Moreover, the walkout appears to involve more workers from the firm's Seoul headquarters than in production and was planned for a single day, TrendForce said. The strike follows other worker protests in recent weeks outside offices in Seoul as well as outside a chip production site in Hwaseong, south of the capital. They started after Samsung Electronics decided to increase wages this year by 5.1%. The NSEU, the biggest of five unions at the firm, want further commitments such as improvements to the performance-based bonus system and an extra day of annual leave. Last week, a coalition of five unions at Samsung affiliates including another smaller Samsung Electronics union called on the NSEU to pursue negotiation rather than confrontation, indicating they would not join the strike. Samsung Electronics' run of success is being challenged in some areas, including in some cutting-edge chips. It recently replaced the head of its semiconductor unit to navigate what it called a \"crisis\" affecting the industry. Any larger scale or protracted industrial action would be a headache for the world's biggest memory chip maker as it scrambles to catch up with rivals making high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI applications. SK Hynix (000660.KS) and Micron (MU.O) are already supplying HBM chips to Nvidia (NVDA.O), which commands about 80% of the global graphic processing unit (GPU) market for AI applications. Nvidia said this week that the three chip makers will provide HBM chips to the U.S. firm, though SK Hynix remains its primary supplier. Last month, Reuters reported that Samsung's HBM chips were yet to pass Nvidia's tests for use, which analysts see as a crucial milestone both reputationally and in terms of profit momentum. While struggling in parts of its chip business, Samsung dethroned Apple (AAPL.O) to become the top smartphone seller globally in the first quarter, accounting for 20% of shipments, according to research firm Counterpoint. Union membership increased rapidly after Samsung in 2020 pledged to end to its practice of discouraging the growth of organised labour. Union officials said, among younger employees, there is growing perception that unions can help create a fairer workplace, whereas older generations felt unions could disrupt productivity. Overall, South Korea's union membership rate has hovered around 10% since 2004, labour ministry data showed."

        "content": "ROME, June 6 (Reuters) - Italy's antitrust regulator said on Thursday it had launched an investigation into pharmaceutical companies including Novartis (NOVN.S)   and Roche-controlled (ROG.S)   Genentech for having potentially restricted competition in the sale of an eye drug. Biopharma developer Samsung Bioepis, biotechs Biogen (BIIB.O)   and Genentech, and Novartis, and some of their Italian, Dutch and UK units, allegedly coordinated their commercial strategies to delay the launch in Italy of Byooviz, a drug made with ranibizumab and developed and sold by Samsung Bioepis, the watchdog said in a statement. Searches had been carried out in Italy, with the support of the finance police, and in the Netherlands by the Dutch regulator, it added. Byooviz is a biosimilar of Lucentis, which was developed by Genentech and sold in Italy and other countries outside the U.S. by Novartis. A biosimilar has a structure that closely mimics an existing biologic drug but is not exactly alike. Ranibizumab injections are used to manage and treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration and macular edema in the eye. The suspected delay may have limited the availability and prices for patients but may also have negative repercussions on possible savings by the Italian national health services, the authority said. Novartis is cooperating with the authority, providing the information requested, a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters. \"Novartis strongly believes that it has acted appropriately and in accordance with competition law and in the best interests of patients,\" she added. Roche in a separate email said it did not comment on regulatory or legal investigations, potential or ongoing. It added that for the company and Genentech, biosimilar competition is a normal part of a treatment's life cycle and that biosimilars \"have an important role to play in supporting the financial sustainability of healthcare systems, while making headroom for innovation\". Samsung Bioepis and Biogen are cooperating with the ongoing investigation and review, the companies' spokespeople said in two separate emailed comments."

        "content": "AMSTERDAM, July 16 (Reuters) - ASML (ASML.AS), the top equipment supplier to computer chip makers, is expected to report an influx of new orders when its new boss delivers second-quarter results on Wednesday, as customers expand capacity to meet booming demand for AI chips. Another focus will be whether Chinese firms have continued heavy purchasing of equipment used to make older generations of chips such as those used in electric cars, a concern for Western policymakers who have curbed buying of more advanced technology. Analysts say the company may upgrade guidance as key makers of cutting-edge chips - including Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), which manufactures chips for Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Apple (AAPL.O), and reports earnings on Thursday - may increase and accelerate equipment purchases. ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, complex tools that use lasers to help create the tiny circuitry of computer chips. It is the only maker of lithography systems using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths, needed by TSMC to make the most complex chips for smart phones and AI chips. \"We expect ASML's order received value to reach close to 5 billion euros in the second quarter, higher than consensus estimates\", Mihuzo analyst Kevin Wang said, with strong orders from TSMC of ASML's EUV product line. The results are the first under ASML's new CEO Christophe Fouquet, who took over the reins at Europe's biggest tech firm as it navigates the ongoing U.S.-China fight over chips. ASML, worth about 400 billion euros ($437 billion), has described 2024 as a \"transition\" year when business will be flat before rebounding strongly in 2025, driven by demand for its most advanced tools. Shares in the group have risen 45% this year and are trading near record highs above 1,000 euros each, about 40 times forecast 12-month forward earnings, significantly higher than the STOXX Europe 600 tech index. A growing order book would reassure investors that demand for the company's most advanced products is returning following a weak first half of 2024, in which it relied heavily on orders of older equipment from China. Analysts are expecting second-quarter net income of 1.41 billion euros on revenue of 6.04 billion euros, according to the mean estimate from 16 analysts, based on LSEG data. That compares with net income of 1.94 billion euros on revenue of 6.90 billion euros in the same period a year ago. ASML had a 38 billion euro order backlog at the end of the first quarter. That means it needs new orders of 4 billion-6 billion euros each quarter to meet its forecast of 2025 sales at the upper end of a 30 billion-40 billion euro range. The company's machines, which cost up to $300 million each, have delivery lead times of 12-18 months, and orders are closely coordinated with customers including Samsung (005930.KS), Intel (INTC.O), and memory specialists SK Hynix (000660.KS) and Micron (MU.O). For slightly older generations of chipmaking technology, it competes with Canon (7751.T) and Nikon (7731.T) of Japan. Chinese firms including Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) are attempting to develop competing lithography tools. But Chinese chipmakers, who are prevented by U.S.-led export restrictions from obtaining ASML's best tools, have escalated their purchases of older ASML equipment in the past year, representing nearly half of company sales in the first quarter. China's rapid increase means lost market share and more competition for non-Chinese firms. The European Commission has begun polling European chip industry firms on whether they feel Chinese state subsidies are distorting markets. ASML argues that world needs older chips, as was shown by shortages during the COVID pandemic, and China is stepping in to supply them. ($1 = 0.9164 euros)"

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's (GOOGL.O)   Google and Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O)   OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology. Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world. \"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said. The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years. Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216. The stock has an average rating of \"buy\" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index (.SPX)   this year, according to LSEG data. Industry analysts expect Samsung (005930.KS)   and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones. Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data."

Global shipments grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, according to the research firm, as smartphone makers look to artificial intelligence to entice price-wary consumers and capture a larger market share. There is \"lots of excitement\" in the smartphone market, thanks to higher average selling prices and the buzz around gen AI smartphones, which are expected to capture 19% of the market this year, said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team. \"As Apple and Samsung both continue to push the top of the market and benefit the most from the ongoing premiumization trend, many leading Chinese OEMs are increasing shipments in the low end in an attempt to capture volume share amid weak demand,\" Popal said, adding that the share of mid-range devices is challenged, as a result. Apple held its developer conference last month where it showcased new AI features for its iPhones powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT. Samsung also held its Galaxy Unpacked event last week where it announced new models for its Galaxy fold and flip as well as new AI features.

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O)   and Nvidia (NVDA.O)  , has benefited from a surge towards AI that has pushed TSMC's stock - and the broader Taiwan market (.TWII)   - to record highs. Last week, its American Depositary Receipts topped a trillion dollar market value. TSMC is set to report a net profit of T$236.1 billion ($7.25 billion) for the quarter ended June 30, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 20 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2023 second-quarter net profit of T$181.8 billion. TSMC last week reported a jump in second-quarter revenue, comfortably beating market expectations. \"I expect the third quarter outlook for all of their products to be very good,\" said President Capital Management Co Chairman Li Fang-kuo. TSMC, at its quarterly earnings call at 0600 GMT on Thursday, will update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including its capital expenditure as it races to expand production. TSMC is spending billions building new factories overseas, including $65 billion on three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona, though it says most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. On its last earnings call in April, TSMC maintained its guidance for capital spending this year at $28 billion to $32 billion, compared with last year's $30.45 billion, and said 70% to 80% of that would go towards advanced technologies. \"TSMC could raise their capital spending,\" said KGI Securities Investment Advisory Co Chairman Chu Yen-min. \"There are many positive factors which will help their stock price and support the broader market.\" The AI boom has helped drive up the price of shares in Asia's most valuable company, with TSMC's Taipei-listed stock leaping 75% so far this year to historic highs, compared with a 33% gain for the broader market. TSMC, colloquially referred to the \"sacred mountain protecting the country\" for its critical role in Taiwan's export-dependent economy, faces little competition, though both Intel (INTC.O)   and Samsung (005930.KS)   are trying to challenge that dominance.

        "content": "SINGAPORE, July 12 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O) push into software is going well and the company could have cumulative software revenue of $1 billion by the end of 2027, Chief Technology Officer Greg Lavender told Reuters. Intel made north of $100 million in software revenue in 2021, the year Lavender was brought in from cloud computing company VMware by CEO Pat Gelsinger to steer the chipmaker's software strategy. Since then, Intel has bought three software companies. \"I have a goal of getting to $1 billion of software and developer cloud subscription revenue,\" he said. \"I think I'm on track to hit this goal by the end of 2027 ... maybe sooner.\" Intel, which generated $54 billion in revenue in 2023, offers a range of software services and tools for hire, ranging from cloud computing to artificial intelligence. Lavender said his strategy is to focus on providing services in AI, performance and security and the company has been investing in all three areas. Separately, Lavender said Intel is seeing \"lots of demand\" for its upcoming Gaudi 3 chip, which he believes can help the company take second place in the AI chip market. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD.O) AI processors have so far not made much headway into denting the dominance of market leader Nvidia (NVDA.O), which controlled roughly 83% of the data center chip market in 2023. Lavender said Intel is supporting open-source initiatives seeking to build software and tools that will be able to power a wide range of AI chips and expects further breakthroughs in coming months. Part of Nvidia's success is linked to its software CUDA, which keeps developers tied to Nvidia chips. France's antitrust regulator is set to charge Nvidia for suspected anti-competitive behaviour, sources have said. The watchdog has voiced concerns about the generative AI sector's dependence on CUDA. Intel is part of the UXL Foundation, a consortium of tech companies developing an open-source project that aims to make computer code run on any machine, regardless of what chip and hardware powers it. Other members include Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Arm Holdings . Lavender added that Intel is contributing to Triton, an OpenAI-led initiative to build an open-source programming language designed to enhance code efficiency across AI chips. AMD and Meta are also supporting the project. Triton is already running on Intel's existing graphics processing units and will work on the company's next generation of AI chips. \"Triton is going to level the playing field,\" he said."

        "content": "HONG KONG, July 11 (Reuters) - Hedge funds hunting for artificial intelligence-related stock market bargains are rushing into South Korea's chipmakers, betting a new wave of demand for high-end memory chips and government spending makes them more valuable. Britain's Man Group (EMG.L)  , Singapore's FengHe Fund Management and Hong Kong's CloudAlpha Capital Management and East Eagle Asset Management are among the hedge funds seeking AI exposure in Asia that are looking to South Korean behemoths such as SK Hynix (000660.KS)   and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , which have so far lagged the sector's rally. \"If we consider Nvidia the king of the AI story, then Hynix is the queen,\" said Matt Hu, chief investment officer of $4 billion FengHe, which has been buying Hynix and Samsung this year. FengHe and other hedge fund investors believe the AI frenzy over the past year that trebled the value of U.S.-listed Nvidia's (NVDA.O)   shares to more than $3 trillion has left behind stocks such as Hynix relative to more popular Asian AI players such as Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW)  . But the spotlight is turning to South Korean chipmakers as technology firms in the generative AI race scurry to secure high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips manufactured primarily by Hynix, Samsung and U.S.-based Micron Technology (MU.O)  . Hynix is the top supplier of advanced HBM memory chips to Nvidia. FengHe's Hu estimates Hynix receives a larger proportion of its revenue from Nvidia than TSMC does, but Hynix trades at 9 times its 12-month forward earnings versus 23 times for TSMC. There are other broader tailwinds to these shares, such as the South Korean government's 26 trillion won ($19 billion) support package for the chip industry and its new 'Corporate Value-up Programme', along the lines of similar efforts in Japan and China to improve shareholder returns. The rush of hedge fund cash into South Korea's AI sector helped the benchmark KOSPI index (.KS11)   register its best month in seven months in June. South Korean stocks attracted the strongest inflows among Asia emerging markets so far this year, and their biggest inflows since 2008, according to LSEG data. The rewards of being invested in South Korea outweigh the big risks, hedge funds say, namely pressure from a depreciating Korean won and restrictions on short-selling of shares in the local market. KOSPI is trading at 10 times 12-month forward earnings, compared with Taiwan's (.TWII)   18 times and Japan's (.TOPX)   15 times. Samsung and Hynix account for about 30% of KOSPI by market capitalisation. While Hynix shares are up more than 70% this year, Samsung is up only 12% and the overall KOSPI nearly 9%. Beyond HBM chips, scarcity in the supply of broader memory chips has further bolstered South Korean suppliers. Samsung said last week it expected a more than 15-fold rise in its second-quarter operating profit, thanks to rising chip prices. Sumant Wahi, a portfolio manager at Man Group focusing on technology stocks, expects prices of traditional Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) chips to rise too because the chip industry has shifted significant capacity to manufacturing HBM. \"There's definitely an opportunity there,\" he said. Pierre Hoebrechts, head of macro research at East Eagle Asset Management, expects Samsung to catch up in the second half due to its significant underperformance compared to TSMC this year. The South Korean AI theme is also broadening beyond chipmakers. Chris Wang, a portfolio manager at tech-focused CloudAlpha Capital Management, has invested in electricity equipment maker HD Hyundai Electric (267260.KS) this year, betting the stock will benefit from the spurt in power consumption. Its shares are up 333% since January. \"Korea has the potential to sell more semiconductor equipment, cooling systems and even consumer electronics along with the growing AI ecosystem,\" said Simon Woo, Asia-Pacific technology research coordinator at BofA Securities. The long-running Sino-U.S. technology war also ensures China keeps using South Korea's advanced memory chips, given Chinese chipmakers have so far been unable to compete while under U.S. export bans, Woo added.

The appeal is based on the legal judgment that the South Korean government was not \"officially\" party to the case considered by the Netherlands-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), the justice ministry said in a statement. Mason Capital, a hedge fund, also did not have legal authority to bring the claim as it did not hold enough shares in Samsung C&T (028260.KS)   at the time the case was filed, it added. Mason Capital had claimed $200 million, arguing its investors suffered damage as a result of the South Korean government's influence over the merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. In its ruling in April, the PCA panel ordered the South Korean government to pay about $11 million in fees and interest in addition to the $32 million award. The PCA case was reviewed under the free trade agreement between South Korea and the United States and the rules of the U.N. Commission on international trade law, according to the April ruling."

The wedding of the billionaire's youngest son Anant Ambani, 29, and his long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant, 29, is the culmination of lavish celebrations throughout the year and according to police, has been deemed a \"public event\" due to the presence of international and Indian household names. Raising the ire of locals, roads near the venue - the upmarket Jio World Convention Centre owned by Ambani's Reliance conglomerate in Mumbai's central business district - will be open only for \"event vehicles\" between 1 p.m. and midnight July 12-15. And that's despite Mumbai being notorious for its congested traffic, particularly at this time of year during the monsoon season. Traffic already has slowed around the immediate area around the venue which is being adorned with decorative lights and red flowers. Marigolds and bright yellow lights have also been used to decorate the trees outside Ambani's 27-storey mansion, Antilia, in Mumbai. Other celebrities expected to attend the event include former boxing heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, U.S. wrestling superstar and actor John Cena and actor Jean-Claude Van Damme, according to a source with knowledge of the plans. From politics, former British Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson and India's Defence Minister Rajnath Singh are set to attend, while the CEO of Saudi Aramco, Amin H Nasser, and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   Chairman Jay Y.

Last week, Justin Bieber performed for hundreds of guests at a private pre-wedding concert and in March, Rihanna sang at a separate three-day event in western Gujarat state. In May, a pre-nuptial luxury European cruise with 800 guests included Bollywood stars and cricketers. Videos and photos of recent celebrations - including a video of the Ambani family lip syncing and dancing to a Bollywood song as well as one of Mukesh Ambani and his wife driving along with their grandchildren - have flooded social media and are being extensively covered by Indian media. Friday's wedding will feature traditional Hindu rituals and the reception will be held over two days. On Monday, there will be a \"special reception\" for Ambani's household staff, according to a document detailing the plans. Rajan Mehra, chief executive of Club One Air, said the Ambanis have hired three of his company's Falcon-2000 jets to ferry wedding guests and expects 100 plus private planes to be used for the events. \"The guests are coming from all over and each aircraft will make multiple trips across the country,\" he said. For some Mumbai residents, it's all too much with social media buzzing with complaints. \"How can it be a public event? Surprised by special treatment on the pain of normal public,\" asked one user on X. \"If it is a public event, can I go inside??,\" asks another."

        "content": "SEOUL, July 10 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   unveiled its latest foldable smartphones on Wednesday, making its priciest flagship model lighter and slimmer and bolstering AI functions as it challenges Apple's (AAPL.O)   dominance in the premium market. Samsung is also offering more sophisticated health monitoring functions to drive new demand for accessories such as its smartwatch, as well as a new ring for easy health monitoring and screen control. The world's largest smartphone maker pioneered the foldable segment in 2019, but Wednesday's launch is crucial as Samsung's foldable phone shipment share fell from 81% in 2022 to 63% in 2023 with competitors surging into the market, according to data provider Canalys. In response, Samsung made the wide Galaxy Z Fold 6 its lightest and slimmest ever to attract customers. The clamshell Galaxy Z Flip 6 has a longer battery life, higher resolution camera and a new vapour chamber to keep the phone cooler, reducing pain points discovered through customer interviews. The company on Wednesday priced the Z Flip 6 at $1,099.99, and the Z Fold 6 to start at $1,899.99, hiking prices by just $100 versus last year's model despite a steep jump in materials costs and after keeping launch prices the same for three years. Samsung offers new AI functions including a \"listening mode\" that provides simultaneous interpretation by voice when paired with Galaxy Buds earphones. It also worked with Alphabet's (GOOGL.O)   Google for new AI search functions, including showing a math problem's solution with all the steps when it is circled on the screen. A slew of new health functions was added to its Galaxy Watch products, with new sensors and a 3-nanometre chip that tripled application booting and processing efficiencies versus last year's model. It is now a U.S. FDA-approved monitoring device for sleep apnea. It also provides measurements of a key cycling data called functional threshold power (FTP) for biking enthusiasts, and even measures a bio-marker related to diabetes called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Samsung's bet that health monitoring will drive new demand culminates in the new Galaxy Ring, a product years in the making. At $399, it is light at 3 grams (0.1 ounce) or less, able to be worn in the shower or while swimming, and can constantly monitor heart rate and stress levels as well as help control a Samsung phone's camera or alarm. \"Bringing AI-powered health and fitness features to wearables will be important to differentiate\" Samsung from other smartwatch vendors, and is \"core to attracting brand switchers in the premium segment,\" said Jack Leathem, Research Analyst at Canalys. The products will be available starting July 24 in South Korea, North America and Europe."

        "content": "SEOUL, July 10 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics' (005930.KS)   biggest workers' union in South Korea said on Wednesday it will continue a strike indefinitely, stepping up its campaign against the tech giant for better pay and benefits. The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), whose roughly 30,000 members make up almost a quarter of the company's South Korean workforce, said it has decided to indefinitely extend the strike that started on Monday because management had shown no indication of holding talks. The strike was initially planned to last three days through Wednesday. It adds to challenges for the world's biggest memory chipmaker which is struggling to navigate competition in semiconductors used for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Union officials said 6,500 workers had participated in the strike, and they urged more members to join. \"It is time that we need power and help from our fellow members,\" Lee Hyun-kuk, the union's vice president, said in a YouTube live broadcast. \"Really our objective is to stop (chip production) lines,\" he said. Lee told Reuters the strike had disrupted production on certain chip lines, with equipment running more slowly. Samsung said the strike had caused no disruption during the first three days. \"Samsung Electronics will ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines. The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union,\" it said in a statement. Samsung's share price closed up 0.1% on Wednesday, while the benchmark KOSPI index (.KS11)   was little changed. To boost participation, the union said it plans to hold advertising campaigns at cafeterias inside chipmaking plants producing 8-inch wafers and high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that are in high demand for use in AI processors. Union officials have disputed media reports of low participation, telling Reuters that the five-year-old body did not have enough time to educate members about the labour issues. The union held training sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. The officials also said a former union leader at Hyundai Motor (005380.KS)  , an auto giant with 60% of workers in South Korea unionised, was sharing history and experience of their strikes. Hyundai and its South Korean union reached a tentative wage deal this week, potentially avoiding a strike. Analysts said it would be difficult to verify whether the strike has disrupted Samsung's production unless the union provides details of wafers and processes impacted. The union said it has revised demands to include a 3.5% increase in base salary and, instead of an extra day's annual leave, a day off to mark the union's founding. Lee said the management previously offered a 3% rise in base salary but the union wants more to better reflect inflation. It also wants equality in the bonus system between rank-and-file workers and executives. Lee Kyungmook, a business professor at Seoul National University, said the union's strike might not get broad support among workers because there's little incentive left for them as any disruption would directly impact their wages. \"If their company can't make money because production lines aren't operating, the amount of bonus will be significantly cut. Then the strike won't be able to gain momentum,\" Lee said."

It is the first order Samsung has revealed for its cutting-edge 2-nanometre chip contract manufacturing process. Samsung did not elaborate on the size of the order. The chips will be made using high-tech chip architecture known as gate all-around (GAA) and multiple chips will be integrated in one package to enhance inter-connection speed and reduce size, Samsung said in a statement. South Korea's Gaonchips Co (399720.KQ)   designed the chips, Samsung said. The chips will go toward Preferred Networks' high-performance computing hardware for generative AI technologies such as large language models, Junichiro Makino, Preferred Networks vice president and chief technology officer of computing architecture, said in the statement."

        "content": "HWASEONG, South Korea, July 8 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   workers began a three-day strike for better pay on Monday, with their union pointing to further action should South Korea's biggest conglomerate continue to fall short of its demands. The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), whose roughly 30,000 members make up almost a quarter of the firm's South Korean workforce, also wants an extra day of annual leave for unionised workers and changes to the employee bonus system. Low participation and automated production means the strike is unlikely to have a significant impact on output at the world's biggest memory chipmaker, analysts said. Still, it signals a decline in staff morale at a pivotal point in the chip industry as tech firms embrace artificial intelligence. The union's first industrial action last month involved coordinating annual leave to stage a mass walkout, which Samsung said had no impact on business activity. The firm said on Monday there was no disruption in production. The union, which did not disclose last month's strike participation levels, said 6,540 workers will be striking this week, mostly at manufacturing sites and in product development. It said the strike includes workers who monitor automated production lines and equipment so operations could be affected. Union officials said about 3,000 strikers attended a rally in the rain near Samsung's headquarters in Hwaseong, south of Seoul. Union president Son Woo-mok disputed media reports of low participation, telling Reuters that the five-year-old union did not have enough time to educate members about the issues. \"Education about labour unions ... has not been enough. But I don't think this participation is low because our union is still young compared to other unions,\" he said. Lee Hyun-kuk, the union's vice president, said there could be further strikes if Samsung does not improve its proposals. Samsung's proposals include flexibility in pay and annual leave conditions but do not meet union demands of increased pay and leave, Lee told Reuters. Union officials also want equality in the bonus system. They said bonuses for rank-and-file workers are calculated by deducting the cost of capital from operating profit, whereas those for executives are based on personal performance goals. \"I was telling people that I was proud to work at Samsung, but the truth is I am not,\" said Park Jun-ha, 20, an engineer at Samsung's chip packaging lines who joined the firm in January, adding that he was not satisfied with its \"opaque\" bonus scheme. The union's membership has grown since Samsung pledged in 2020 to stop discouraging organised labour. Its growing voice is demanding attention just as Samsung struggles to navigate competition in chips used for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, analysts said. Samsung's share price performance has lagged compatriot chip rival SK Hynix (000660.KS)  , with union officials blaming Samsung's AI woe on slow development in high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips that are in high demand for use in AI processors. Even so, Samsung estimated a more than 15-fold rise in second-quarter operating profit on Friday, as rebounding chip prices driven by the AI boom lifted earnings from the year prior's low comparison base. Its share price was up 0.2% in afternoon trade on Monday after rising as much as 1.72% earlier in the session to its highest since January 2021. Last week, it jumped 6.9% on preliminary quarterly earnings that exceeded analyst estimates."

        "content": "HANOI, July 5 (Reuters) - Vietnam has missed out on multi-billion dollar investments by multinationals including Intel and LG Chem because it lacks sufficient investment incentives, the country's investment ministry said in a document reviewed by Reuters. U.S. chipmaker Intel (INTC.O)   had proposed to invest $3.3 billion in a project in Vietnam and asked the country for \"cash support\" of 15%, but later decided to move the project to Poland, the ministry said in the document dated June 29. South Korea's LG Chem Ltd (051910.KS)   also skipped Vietnam to invest in a battery project in Indonesia, after having asked Vietnam to cover 30% of the investment cost, the document said. The two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the assessment by the Ministry of Planning and Investment, which was due to present plans for an investment incentive fund to the central government on Friday for approval. \"Recently, many large groups have come to explore investment opportunities in Vietnam but have later decided to move to other countries as Vietnam lacks regulations on investment supports,\" the ministry document said. Vietnam, which is an important manufacturing base for companies such as Samsung Electronics, Foxconn and Intel, is heavily reliant on foreign investment for growth. Companies with foreign investment account for about 70% of its total exports. The ministry document confirmed a November report by Reuters that Intel had shelved a planned investment in Vietnam that could have nearly doubled the U.S. chipmaker's operation in the Southeast Asian country. The document added that Austria-based semiconductor manufacturer AT&S had decided to invest in Malaysia after its request for investment supports in Vietnam were not met, and said Samsung Electronics was moving some production to India. AT&S and Samsung Electronics could not immediately be reached for comment. Multinationals have been watching Vietnam's plans to set up the investment incentive fund after the country's parliament last year approved the OECD-led global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, raising the effective tax level paid by companies."

        "content": "SEOUL, July 5 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   estimated on Friday a more than 15-fold rise in its second-quarter operating profit, as rebounding semiconductor prices driven by the artificial intelligence boom lifted earnings from a low base a year ago. The world's largest memory chip, smartphone and TV maker estimated its operating profit rose to 10.4 trillion won ($7.54 billion) in the quarter ended June 30, from 670 billion won a year earlier. The profit beat a 8.8 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate, and the quarter was its most profitable since the third quarter of 2022. In addition to higher chip prices, the better-than-expected profit likely reflected Samsung reversing its previous inventory writedowns on its books, as the value of its chip inventory has rebounded in accounting terms, analysts said. Revenue likely rose 23% in the second quarter from the same period a year earlier to 74 trillion won, Samsung said. Samsung shares opened up 1.2% after the guidance, versus a 0.4% rise in the wider market (.KS11)  . The company is due to release detailed second-quarter earnings on July 31. Samsung's key semiconductor division likely posted its second consecutive quarterly profit, improving on the first quarter, as memory chip prices keep rising from a mid-2022 to end-2023 trough that was caused by weak post-pandemic demand for gadgets that use the chips. Explosive demand for high-end DRAM chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI chipsets, as well as chips used in data centre servers and gadgets that run AI services have helped buoy chip prices, analysts said. During the second quarter, memory chip prices jumped by about 13% to 18% versus the previous quarter for DRAM chips used in tech devices and 15% to 20% for NAND Flash chips used for data storage, according to data provider TrendForce. But the climb in memory chip prices may slow in third quarter, with TrendForce forecasting a 5% to 10% price hike for both conventional DRAM and NAND Flash chips, as demand for older, legacy chips from the consumer electronics market remains lacklustre. \"At the earnings call at the end of the month, we will be interested in Samsung's outlook on legacy chips, which will be a sign for whether this chip industry recovery can last into next year,\" said Ko Yeongmin, an analyst at Daol Investment & Securities. AI-driven demand for high-end chips such as HBM and solid-state drives (SSDs) will outperform the rest of the market, analysts said, though Samsung has been lagging behind South Korean rival SK Hynix (000660.KS)   in the supply of high-end HBM chips to customers like Nvidia (NVDA.O)  . U.S. memory chip rival Micron Technology (MU.O)   beat estimates for its latest quarterly revenue last week driven by a demand surge from the AI industry, although its current-quarter forecast disappointed investors who had been even more upbeat. Investors are awaiting news of whether Samsung's latest fourth-generation HBM chips will receive approval to supply Nvidia after they failed earlier tests due heat and power consumption problems, according to sources. Samsung in May replaced the chief of its semiconductor division in a bid to overcome what it called a \"chip crisis\". Shares in Samsung were up 8% year-to-date as of Thursday, compared to SK Hynix shares' 63% rise. ($1 = 1,379.8700 won)"

That amount would be Samsung's highest profit since the third quarter of 2022. It compares with an operating profit of 670 billion won in second quarter of last year.

This compares to a loss of 4.36 trillion won for the same period last year. Its mobile business likely saw its Q2 operating profit shrink versus last year despite shipping a similar number of smartphones, analysts said, due to steeper parts' costs and higher marketing and development costs for AI services. The mobile business likely reported an operating profit of around 2.2 trillion won, according to an average of forecasts from 10 analysts, down from a 3.04 trillion won profit a year ago.

        "content": "July 2 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court has reversed a decision that would have required Samsung Electronics to pay millions of dollars in arbitration fees to respond to thousands of consumer privacy claims. In a case that could help define the scope of consumer mass arbitration, the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday overturned a lower court decision that said Samsung must arbitrate the consumers\u2019 claims and pay administrative fees in the process. The unanimous three-judge panel said the plaintiffs had not shown they had valid arbitration agreements. The panel also said the order requiring Samsung to pay administrative fees was beyond the power of the trial judge. Samsung and lawyers for the consumers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The appeals court\u2019s order was a setback for tens of thousands of Illinois consumers who sought to pursue their privacy claims through arbitration rather than in court. The plaintiffs sued Samsung in U.S. federal court in 2022, seeking an order compelling the device maker to arbitrate claims that it was violating a state law that curbs the collection and use of personal biometric information such as facial scans and fingerprints. Samsung has denied the allegations, calling them \"frivolous.\" Samsung in its appeal challenged the consumers\u2019 contention that they had valid arbitration agreements. The company also disputed that it had refused to arbitrate. The appeals court said the consumers had not presented enough information to confirm they were Samsung purchasers. The court said a spreadsheet of names and addresses was not enough to prove the consumers were Samsung customers. Consumer information such as receipts and order numbers would have proved an arbitration agreement, the appeals panel said. The consumers had argued that the court had no power to hear the appeal since the trial judge ordered the dispute into arbitration. They also argued that they should be given a chance in the lower court to prove that the 35,651 Illinois consumers who filed arbitration demands had valid agreements. \u201cThe consumers had the opportunity to present their evidence, and they failed to do so,\u201d wrote Circuit Judge Thomas Kirsch II, joined by Chief Judge Diane Sykes and Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook. The appeals court said that the status of the case \u201cdoes not allow second chances.\u201d The case is Paula Wallrich et al v.

        "content": "HANOI, July 2 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Ministry of Planning and Investment is finalising a draft plan to set up a fund to help attract foreign investment and maintain the country's competitiveness, according to a ministry document reviewed by Reuters. The draft will be submitted to the central government by Friday, according to the document dated June 29. The Southeast Asian country, which is an important manufacturing base for companies like Samsung Electronics, Foxconn and Intel, is heavily reliant on foreign investment for growth. Companies with foreign investment account for around 70% of its total exports. The fund and other incentives have been highly anticipated by multinationals after Vietnam's parliament last year approved the OECD-led global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, raising the effective tax level paid by companies. The fund, which would be financed by the state budget and by revenue from corporate tax, was part of efforts to \"maintain Vietnam's competitiveness in the face of changeable global conditions and fierce competition among countries in attracting investment,\" the document said. The Vietnam Fund for Investment Support would provide cash to projects to partly cover costs for infrastructure, fixed assets and human resource training. Vietnam aims to attract $30-$40 billion of foreign investment a year in the 2021-2025 period, and $40-$50 billion annually in the 2026-2030 period, the document said. Foreign investment inflows last year rose 34.5% to $39.4 billion, it said. \"Though foreign investment in Vietnam has been rising over recent years, the number of large-scale foreign investment projects with high technologies remain modest, while some existing projects have suspended their plans to expand,\" the document said. It said some potential big investors were still deliberating on whether to invest in Vietnam, pending more information about investment incentives. According to the draft, investments eligible for the incentives would include high-tech projects worth at least 12 trillion dong ($471.51 million) and with annual revenues of at least 20 trillion dong. Projects investing in artificial intelligence and semiconductors worth at least 6 trillion dong, and projects to develop research and development centres worth at least 3 trillion dong would also be eligible. \"The fund would not solely be aimed at compensating firms affected by the global minimum tax, but at encouraging all investment projects,\" the document said. ($1 = 25,450 dong)"

        "content": "SEOUL, July 2 (Reuters) - A workers' union at Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   in South Korea has called a strike for July 8-10, union officials said on Tuesday, as it steps up industrial action against the country's most valuable company. The union is determining how many workers will join the strike, Lee Hyun-kuk, vice president of the National Samsung Electronics Union, told Reuters by telephone. Son Woo-mok, leader of the union, said late on Monday that the union wants a more transparent system for bonuses and time off, and wants the company to treat it as an equal partner. Samsung declined to comment on the union's strike plan. Its share price closed little changed, compared with a 0.8% decline in the benchmark price index (.KS11)  . Union membership increased rapidly after Samsung in 2020 pledged to stop discouraging the growth of organised labour. The strike's purpose was to disrupt production, and the union could consider taking another round of strike if the company does not hear its demands, Lee said in a live YouTube broadcast later on Tuesday. Analysts, however, say the strike itself is unlikely to have a major impact on chip output as most production at the world's biggest memory chipmaker is automated. Any impact will ultimately depend on how many people who operate chip plants participate and for how long, said senior researcher Kim Yang-Paeng at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade. \"Chip production cannot proceed with replacement workers\" if people who operate the automated machines walked out for a long time \"because of the specificity and expertise of the work,\" Kim said. Last month, workers took annual leave on the same day in what was effectively the union's first industrial action. At the time, Samsung said there was no impact on production or business activity. Those striking were mainly employed at inner-city offices rather than at manufacturing sites, analysts said. \"This planned strike marks a turning point in Samsung's history of non-union management. This could be seen as a drop in employee loyalty at Samsung ... caused by wages and disappointing compensation compared to Samsung's rivals,\" a Seoul-based analyst said on Tuesday, declining to be identified as details of the strike were unknown."

The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), whose roughly 28,000 members make up over a fifth of the firm's workforce, is planning to begin the strike on July 8, asking the company for commitments such as improvements to its performance-based bonus system and an extra day of annual leave. \"We are declaring a general strike today,\" Son Woo-mok, president of NSEU, said on a live YouTube broadcast. \"Until our demands are met, we will fight with the 'no pay no work' general strike.\" The union will provide more details regarding the strike on Tuesday, it said in a statement. Samsung Electronics did not provide an immediate comment. Last month, the union staged a walkout by using an annual leave, its first such industrial action, but the company at the time said there was no impact on production or business activity. As the world's top memory chipmaker and a major global smartphone maker, Samsung Electronics' run of success is being challenged in some areas, including in some cutting-edge chips. It recently replaced the head of its semiconductor unit to navigate what it called a \"crisis\" affecting the industry. Any larger scale or protracted industrial action would be a headache for Samsung as it scrambles to catch up with rivals making high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in AI applications. Union membership increased rapidly after Samsung in 2020 pledged to end to its practice of discouraging the growth of organised labour."

        "content": "SAN JOSE, California, March 19 (Reuters) - Nvidia's (NVDA.O)   stock climbed on Tuesday after the heavyweight chipmaker said its new flagship AI processor is expected to ship later this year and CEO Jensen Huang said he is chasing a data center market potentially greater than $250 billion. Nvidia's stock rose nearly 2% to $901 after Huang and Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress answered questions from investors at the company's annual developer conference in San Jose, California. The shares had dipped nearly 4% earlier in the day. \"We think we're going to come to market later this year,\" Kress said, referring to the company's new AI chip, which the company debuted on Monday. Huang estimated that companies operating data centers will spend more than $250 billion a year to upgrade them with accelerated computing components that Nvidia specializes in developing. He said that market was growing by as much as 25% a year. Nvidia is shifting from selling single chips to selling total systems, potentially winning a larger chunk of spending within data centers. \"Nvidia doesn't build chips, it builds data centers,\" Huang said. Called Blackwell, Nvidia's new processor combines two squares of silicon the size of the company's previous offering. Nvidia also detailed a new set of software tools to help developers sell artificial-intelligence models more easily to firms that use its technology. Nvidia is working with contract chip manufacturer TSMC (2330.TW) to avoid bottlenecks in packaging chips that slowed shipments of its previous flagship AI processor, Huang said. \"The volume ramp in demand happened fairly sharply last time, but this time, we've had plenty of visibility\" into demand for Blackwell chips, Huang said. Some analysts said Wall Street has already factored in the debut of the B200 Blackwell chip, which the company claims is 30 times faster at some tasks than its predecessor. The Blackwell chip will be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, Huang told CNBC. Huang later clarified that comment, saying Nvidia will include its new chip in larger computing systems and that prices will vary based on how much value they provide. \"The Blackwell technology shows a significant performance uplift compared to Hopper (the current flagship chip) but it's always hard to live up to the hype,\" said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. In a discussion about Nvidia's cooperation with South Korean chipmakers, Huang said Nvidia is qualifying Samsung Electronics' (005930.KS) high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. Reuters reported last week that Samsung's HBM3 series have not yet passed Nvidia's qualification for supply deals. Samsung's cross-town rival SK Hynix (000660.KS) on Tuesday said it has begun mass production of next-generation HBM3E chips, with sources saying initial shipments will go to Nvidia this month. At the center of Wall Street's AI euphoria, Nvidia's stock has more than tripled over the past 12 months, making it the U.S. stock market's third-most valuable company, behind only Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O). Even after that meteoric rally, Nvidia is trading at about 35 times its expected earnings, cheap compared with its PE of 58 a year ago, according to LSEG data. That decline in Nvidia's PE valuation is the result of analysts massively increasing their estimates of the chipmaker's future earnings, and if those forecasts turn out to be too optimistic, Nvidia's stock risks plummeting back to earth. Nvidia expects major customers including Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Meta Platforms (META.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), OpenAI and Tesla (TSLA.O) to use its new chip. Its hardware products will likely remain \"best-of-breed\" in the AI industry, Morningstar analysts said, lifting their estimates for Nvidia data-center revenue for 2026 and 2028. \"We remain impressed with Nvidia's ability to elbow into additional hardware, software, and networking products and platforms,\" they said. The software push shows how Nvidia, whose chips are mostly used to train large-language models like Google's Gemini, is trying to make its hardware easier to adapt for companies rushing to integrate generative AI into their businesses. Many analysts expect Nvidia's market share to drop several percentage points this year, as competitors launch new products and the company's largest customers make their own chips, although its dominance is expected to remain unchallenged."

The new type of chip - called the HBM3E - is a focal point of intense competition. Last month, Micron Technology (MU.O)   said it had started mass production of the chips while Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   said it had developed the industry's first 12-stack HBM3E chips. SK Hynix has, however, led the HBM chip market by virtue of being the sole supplier of the version currently used - the HBM3 - to Nvidia which has 80% of the market for AI chips. \"The company expects successful mass production of HBM3E and with our experience... as the industry's first provider of HBM3, we expect to cement our leadership in the AI memory space,\" SK Hynix said in a statement. The new HBM3E chip by the world's second-largest memory chipmaker offers 10% improvement in heat dissipation and processes up to 1.18 terabytes of data per second. SK Hynix's HBM capacity is fully booked for 2024, analysts said, as explosive demand for AI chipsets drives up demand for high-end memory chips used in them. \"SK Hynix has secured an absolute market position... and its volume increase in high-end memory chips is also expected to be the most aggressive among chipmakers,\" said Kim Un-ho, analyst at IBK Investment & Securities. Nvidia (NVDA.O)   unveiled on Monday its latest flagship AI chip, the B200, said to be 30 times speedier at some tasks than its predecessor as it seeks to maintain its dominant position in the artificial-intelligence industry. Shares in SK Hynix have doubled in value over the past 12 months on its leading position in HBM chips."

The new technology for communications known as 6G - the successor to 5G - is expected to launch commercially around 2030. Software and AI are increasingly deployed across the telecom sector, including in RAN (radio access network) hardware like base stations and antennas. Nvidia's platform will include an app that simulates environments such as single cell towers or entire cities, allowing researchers and organisations to test 6G networks in real time. Among the first adopters of the platform are Ansys (ANSS.O), Nokia (NOKIA.HE), Samsung (005930.KS), SoftBank Corp (9434.T), and Northeastern University in Boston, Nvidia said. \"The massive increase in connected devices and host of new applications in 6G will require a vast leap in wireless spectral efficiency in radio communications,\" said Ronnie Vasishta, senior vice president of telecom at Nvidia, in a statement. Technology shares (.SX8P) rose on Monday as investors geared up for Nvidia's global artificial intelligence conference for developers in San Jose, California. But European shares edged lower, led by a slump in the telecom sector. Gear maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) closed down 5.4% and peer Nokia (NOKIA.HE) fell 4%. An analyst said that telecom gear suppliers are no longer the sole drivers in the mobile infrastructure market, and that they must partner with chip companies and cloud vendors."

        "content": "March 18 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O)   is in talks to build Google's Gemini artificial intelligence engine into the iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation. The negotiations are about licensing Gemini for some new features coming to the iPhone software this year, the report said, adding that the terms or branding of an AI agreement or how it would be implemented have not been decided. Alphabet shares jumped more than 6% in early U.S. trading, while Apple was up 2.5%. It is unlikely that any deal would be announced until June, when Apple plans to hold its annual conference of developers, and the iPhone maker also recently held talks with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI about using its model, according to the report. Apple, Alphabet-owned (GOOGL.O)   Google and OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. A potential deal between the firms could help Google expand the use of its AI services to more than 2 billion active Apple devices, boosting the search giant's efforts to catch up with Microsoft (MSFT.O)  -backed OpenAI. It could also help allay investor fears about the slow roll-out of AI apps by Apple, which has lost the crown of the world's most valuable firm after a 10% decline in its shares this year. The firms have a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on Apple's Safari web browser, and a genAI tie-up may help the Alphabet unit navigate fears that services like ChatGPT could threaten its search dominance. But the agreement could also invite sharper scrutiny from U.S. regulators, who have sued Google on grounds that it unlawfully stifled competition by paying billions of dollars to Apple to maintain its monopoly in search. \"This strategic partnership is a missing piece in the Apple AI strategy and combines forces with Google for Gemini to power some of the AI features Apple is bringing to market,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush. \"This is a major win for Google to get onto the Apple ecosystem and have access to the golden installed base of Cupertino with clearly a major licence fee attached to this,\" he said, referring to Apple's California headquarters. Google in January partnered with Apple's rival Samsung (005930.KS)   to deploy its genAI technology in the South Korean firm's Galaxy S24 series of smartphones, as part of its efforts to boost the use of Gemini after some missteps during its roll-out. Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month that the company was investing \"significantly\" in generative AI and would reveal more about its plans to put the technology to use later this year. The Bloomberg report said Apple was planning to use its own homegrown AI models for some new capabilities in its upcoming iOS 18, but was seeking a partner to power genAI features, including functions for creating images and writing essays based on simple prompts."

        "content": "TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW)   is looking at building advanced packaging capacity in Japan, according to two sources familiar with the matter, a move that would add momentum to Japan's efforts to reboot its semiconductor industry. The deliberations are at an early stage, they added, declining to be identified as the information was not public. One option the chipmaking giant is considering is bringing its chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) packaging technology to Japan, according to one of the sources who was briefed on the matter. CoWoS is a high-precision technology that involves stacking chips on top of each other, boosting processing power while saving space and reducing power consumption. Currently, all of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is in Taiwan. No decisions on the scale of or the timeline for a potential investment have been made, the source said. TSMC, formally known as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, declined to comment. Demand for advanced semiconductor packaging has surged globally in tandem with the artificial intelligence boom, spurring chipmakers including TSMC, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   and Intel (INTC.O)  , to boost capacity. TSMC Chief Executive C.C. Wei said in January that the company plans to double CoWos output this year with further increases slated in 2025. On Monday, TSMC said it was planning additional advanced packaging capacity in Chiayi in southern Taiwan to respond to strong market demand, without giving details. Construction of a new Chiayi CoWoS plant is due to start in early May, the island's official Central News Agency quoted Vice Premier Cheng Wen-tsan as saying. Building capacity for advanced packaging would extend TSMC's growing operations in Japan where it has just built one plant and announced another - both on the southern island of Kyushu, a chipmaking hub. TSMC is partnering with companies including Sony (6758.T) and Toyota (7203.T) with total investment in the Japan venture expected to run to more than $20 billion. The chipmaker also established an advanced packaging research and development centre in Ibaraki prefecture, northeast of Tokyo in 2021. Japan is seen as well positioned to take a larger role in advanced packaging given that it has leading semiconductor materials and equipment makers, growing investment in chip fabrication capacity and a solid customer base. Advanced packaging would be welcomed in Japan which can offer the ecosystem to support it, a senior official at Japan's industry ministry said. TrendForce analyst Joanne Chiao said, however, that if TSMC were to build advanced packaging capacity in Japan, she expected it would be limited in scale. It was not yet clear how much demand there would be for CoWoS packaging within Japan and most of TSMC's current CoWoS customers are in the United States, she added. TSMC's plans in Japan thus far have been supported by generous subsidies from the Japanese government which - after losing ground to South Korea and Taiwan - sees semiconductors as vital to its economic security. That's spurred an influx of investment from a range of chip firms from Taiwan and elsewhere. Intel is also looking at establishing an advanced packaging research facility in Japan to deepen ties with local chip supply chain companies, two separate sources familiar with the matter said. Intel declined to comment. Samsung is setting up an advanced packaging research facility in Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo, with government support. The South Korean chipmaker is also talking to companies in Japan and elsewhere about procuring materials as it prepares to introduce a packaging technology used by its rival SK Hynix (000660.KS) to catch up in high bandwidth memory chips, Reuters has reported."

Samsung C&T is the Samsung conglomerate's de-facto holding company, with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) Chairman Jay Y. Lee the largest shareholder.

Huh Jae-hwan, an analyst at Eugene Investment Securities, said the vote was symbolic because it is Samsung. \"It was an event that raised doubts over whether there would be real changes in companies' shareholder returns and worries that it would still take a long time for improvements in governance structure of Korean companies,\" Huh said. Still, the 23% vote for the activist proposal was high compared with similar attempts in the past, and given that retail investors don't usually attend the AGMs, analysts said. After the vote, Samsung C&T shares dropped by as much as 10.1%, retreating from a more than eight-year high hit on Thursday, ending the session with their worst daily performance since May 2015. Last month, South Korea unveiled a corporate reform plan, dubbed the \"Corporate Value-up Programme\", in an aim to tackle the so-called \"Korea discount\". The discount refers to a tendency for Korean companies to be undervalued compared with global peers due to factors such as low dividend payouts and the dominance of opaque conglomerates known as chaebols. Earlier this year, a group of Samsung C&T shareholders, led by ANDA Asset Management, City of London Investment Management Company and Whitebox Advisors, submitted a proposal to raise annual dividend payouts to 4,500 won ($3.38) per common share and 4,550 won per preferred share. That compared with the board's proposal of 2,550 won per common share and 2,600 per preferred share, which is a total of 417.3 billion won worth of dividends, already up 11% from 376.4 billion the previous year. Shareholders also voted down 82% to 18% the activists' proposal to allocate 500 billion won to a share repurchase programme. \"Investors' hopes were a little excessive, given that the activist funds' demand was rather unreasonable, and Samsung had already announced its own plan for shareholder return,\" said Kim Soo-hyun, an analyst at DS Investment Securities. \"That said, Samsung may be less motivated than others, because its succession process is already set out and ongoing,\" Kim said. South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), a major stakeholder in Samsung C&T, voted for the board's proposal, saying the activists proposal was \"too much\", a day after NPS said it supported the government's corporate reform plan. The state pension fund has big stakes in major conglomerates. On Thursday, South Korea's financial market watchdog met with asset management firms and urged them to vote in ways that boost investor returns and corporate value at AGMs in March.

        "content": "WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission said Thursday it is investigating if the use of Russian and Chinese foreign satellite systems by U.S. mobile phones and other devices poses security threats. The FCC has concerns U.S. handheld devices are receiving and processing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals from satellites controlled by foreign adversaries in violation of commission rules. The FCC is seeking answers from handset manufacturers Apple (AAPL.O), Google (GOOGL.O), Motorola (MSI.N), Nokia (NOKIA.HE), Samsung (005930.KS) and others that collectively cover over 90% of the U.S. smartphone marketplace. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \"There is no established record of what security threats, if any, these signals carry and whether the manufacturers of handheld devices are processing these signals in violation of the Commission\u2019s rules,\" a FCC spokesperson said. Representative Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select China Committee, wrote FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel earlier this week raising concern about reports that U.S. cell phones were receiving and processing signals from Chinese and Russian satellites. The FCC has only approved U.S. phones to receivers to receive and process signals from the U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and only the European Galileo GNSS has been approved. Gallagher said U.S. devices are receiving signals from the PRC BeiDou and Russian GLONASS GNSS constellations. \"Current events in Eastern Europe (including significant Russian jamming and spoofing of GNSS signals) call into question the wisdom of accepting this workaround and suggest it is critical that the FCC enforce its rules against using unauthorized signals from foreign satellites,\" Gallagher said. Rosenworcel in 2018 raised concerns saying U.S. phones have chips designed to operate with global navigation satellite systems of other countries. \"Many devices in the United States are already operating with foreign signals,\" she said in 2018. The FCC wants to know \"whether their devices are in compliance with FCC rules and what vulnerabilities\" may exist in how they process GNSS signals."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plan to unveil next week in Arizona a multi-billion-dollar award for Intel (INTC.O)   to expand its chip production in the United States, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Intel, which according to one of the sources also invited customers and suppliers to attend the event, declined to comment. The company has sought grants to fund expansion plans in both Ohio and Arizona, a critical political swing state that Biden, who is running for re-election against Republican Donald Trump, hopes to win in November. Intel's award, a mix of grants and loans, will be the most significant to be rolled out so far from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, America's bid to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in funding, including $39 billion in subsidies for semiconductor production and $11 billion for R&D. Last month, the Biden administration awarded $1.5 billion to GlobalFoundries (GFS.O)  , the world's third-largest contract chipmaker, to build a new semiconductor production facility in Malta, New York, and expand existing operations there and in Burlington, Vermont. In January, the U.S. Commerce Department said it planned to award Microchip Technology (MCHP.O)   $162 million in government grants, allowing Microchip to triple production of mature-node semiconductor chips and microcontroller units at two U.S. factories. Awards for South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC are expected in the coming weeks. The goal is to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan, as the share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. has fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Intel's grant will cement Arizona's position as a domestic chipmaking powerhouse, with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW)   announcing a new Phoenix-based facility in 2020 and Intel unveiling plans to add two factories to its Chandler campus there last year. Intel also announced plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking complex in Albany, Ohio, but the Wall Street Journal reported last month that construction is not expected to be finished until late 2026."

        "content": "SEOUL, March 13 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   plans to use a chip making technology championed by rival SK Hynix, five people said, as the world's top memory chipmaker seeks to catch up in the race to produce high-end chips used to power artificial intelligence. The demand for high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips has boomed with the growing popularity of generative AI. But Samsung, unlike peers SK Hynix (000660.KS)   and Micron Technology (MU.O)  , has been conspicuous by its absence in any dealmaking with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA.O)   to supply latest HBM chips. One of the reasons Samsung has fallen behind is its decision to stick with chip making technology called non-conductive film (NCF) that causes some production issues, while Hynix switched to the mass reflow molded underfill (MR-MUF) method to address NCF's weakness, according to analysts and industry watchers. Samsung, however, has recently issued purchase orders for chipmaking equipment designed to handle MUF technique, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. \"Samsung had to do something to ramp up its HBM (production) yields ... adopting MUF technique is a little bit of swallow-your-pride type thing for Samsung, because it ended up following the technique first used by SK Hynix,\" one of the sources said. Samsung said its NCF technology is an \"optimal solution\" for HBM products and would be used in its new HBM3E chips. \"We are carrying out our HBM3E product business as planned,\" Samsung said in response to Reuters' questions on the article. After the article was published, Samsung issued a statement saying \"rumours that Samsung will apply MR-MUF to its HBM production are not true\". The HBM3 and HBM3E are the newest versions of high bandwidth memory chips that are bundled with core microprocessor chips to help process vast amounts of data in generative AI. Samsung's HBM3 chip production yields stand at about 10-20%, lagging SK Hynix that has secured about 60-70% yield rates for its HBM3 production, according to several analysts. Samsung refuted the estimated production yields and said it had secured a \"stable yield rate\" without elaborating. According to one of the sources, Samsung is already in talks with material manufacturers, including Japan's Nagase (8012.T)  , to source MUF materials. But mass production of the high-end chips using MUF is unlikely to be ready until next year at the earliest, as Samsung needs to run more tests, the person added. The three sources, mentioned above, said Samsung plans to use both NCF and MUF techniques for its latest HBM chip. All sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Nvidia and Nagase declined to comment. Any move by Samsung to use MUF would underscore the growing pressure it faces in the AI chip race, with the HBM chip market, according to research firm TrendForce, expected to more than double this year to nearly $9 billion amid AI-related demand. The non-conductive film chip manufacturing technology has been widely used by chipmakers to stack multiple layers of chips in a compact high bandwidth memory chipset, as using thermally compressed thin film helps minimise space between stacked chips. But there are often problems linked to adhesive materials as manufacturing gets complicated as more layers are added. Samsung says its latest HBM3E chip has 12 chip layers. Chipmakers have been looking for alternatives to address such weaknesses. SK Hynix successfully switched to the mass reflow molded underfill technique ahead of others, becoming the first vendor to supply HBM3 chips to Nvidia. SK Hynix's market share in HBM3 and more advanced HBM products for Nvidia is estimated at above 80% this year, according to Jeff Kim, an analyst at KB Securities. Micron joined the high bandwidth memory chip race last month, announcing that its latest HBM3E chip will be adopted by Nvidia to power the latter's H200 Tensor chips which will begin shipping in the second quarter. Samsung's HBM3 series have not yet passed Nvidia's qualification for supply deals, according to one of the four sources and another person with knowledge of the discussion. Its setback in the AI chip race has also been noticed by investors, with its shares falling 6% this year, lagging SK Hynix and Micron which are up 16% and 14%, respectively. On Wednesday, SK Hynix shares closed down 1.3%, while Samsung rose 1%, beating a 0.4% rise in the broader market (.KS11)  ."

Earlier, Fortune said the app could look similar to the TV app offered by Google's Youtube. It cited an unidentified source as saying Musk was set on competing with YouTube. X did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for further details on the app. In the push to become a \"video-first platform\", X has been forging partnerships with the likes of former Fox commentator Tucker Carlson and former CNN anchor Don Lemon. The platform, which has struggled to retain advertisers amid controversies ever since Musk bought it in 2022, said last month it would enable advertisers to run video ads next to certain content creators."

        "content": "HANOI, March 7 (Reuters) - Large foreign multinationals said they may freeze new investment plans in Vietnam in the absence of subsidies to help offset the cost of a new top-up tax, said a person involved in talks on the matter between investors and the government. The investment-reliant manufacturing hub has been one of the main beneficiaries of companies relocating activity from China to minimise the impact of Sino-U.S. tension. But a tax hike alongside power supply problems, regulatory hurdles and wage increases may dent its competitiveness, analysts have said. Vietnam this year introduced the 15% Global Minimum Tax on large multinationals, an initiative shepherded by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In accordance, incentives that lowered tax rates to as little as 5% will no longer be available, meaning some multinationals will effectively have to pay a top-up tax to meet the 15% rate. Some U.S. multinationals have called on the government to honour low-tax commitments it made to attract existing investment, adding that new investment would be difficult without measures to offset the top-up, the person said. The government pledged new subsidies in the first half of last year but has been slow to introduce any. In December, it released a draft decree outlining new subsidies and conditions for eligibility, such as being classed as a high-technology company. But many key aspects remain undefined, such as the size of a new incentives fund, and there is no clear timetable for approval of the measures. Representatives of multinationals on Tuesday raised concerns with officials of the Ministry of Planning and Investment about the size, scope and accessibility of the planned incentives, the person, who attended the meeting, told Reuters on condition of anonymity as the meeting was not public. A representative for Lego Group, which is investing over $1 billion to build a new factory in Vietnam, asked whether firms not classed as high-tech such as Lego would be eligible for any of the subsidies outlined under the draft decree, to which a ministry official replied they would not, the person said. The Danish toy maker confirmed to Reuters that one of its representatives asked a question on the matter in the meeting. A representative for U.S. firm Amkor Technology (AMKR.O)  , which is building in Vietnam a $1.6 billion plant to assemble, test and package semiconductors, said it has struggled to obtain classification as a high-tech company, the person said. Representatives for Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , the largest foreign investor, did not intervene in the meeting, the person said. The South Korean company has been among the most vocal about measures to offset the increased tax burden. Amkor Technology and the Ministry of Planning and Investment did not respond to requests for comment. Samsung declined to comment. Through the top-up tax, the government has estimated additional annual tax revenue of 14.6 trillion dong ($591 million) from 122 foreign companies. It has said it intends to use this windfall to give cash handouts to investing companies. Still, new subsidies would not offer direct compensation for the increased tax burden, in line with the Global Minimum Tax initiative, government officials told the corporate representatives on Tuesday, according to the person. A direct link would breach the international agreement behind the initiative and could lead to the transfer of the additional revenue to multinationals' home countries, OECD officials have said, though enforcement measures remain unclear. However, for some companies, the new subsidies could cover a large part - if not all - of the top-up tax costs, experts familiar with discussions on the incentives have said. ($1 = 24,700.0000 dong)"

        "content": "HANOI, March 7 (Reuters) - Communist Party-ruled Vietnam upgraded ties with Australia on Thursday, in the latest success for its \"bamboo diplomacy\", after it boosted relations last year with the world's top powers, as it tries to navigate rising global tensions. After a string of deals in recent months, the Southeast Asian country's top partners now include the United States, China, India, South Korea and Russia, which for decades has supplied most of Vietnam's military equipment. Below are details of Vietnam's increasingly dynamic foreign policy approach and its most important diplomatic agreements over the last months. A regional manufacturing powerhouse, Vietnam is an increasingly strategic player in global supply chains. To bolster this position, the country's most powerful figure, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, used in 2021 the imagery of \"strong roots, stout trunk, and flexible branches\" of the bamboo plant to describe Vietnam's foreign policy approach of having \"more friends, fewer foes\". Vietnam and China agreed in December to build a community with a \"shared future\" during a visit to Hanoi by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two nations signed 36 cooperation documents in areas such as transport infrastructure, trade, security and digital economy, and published a joint declaration with wide-ranging commitments. China is Vietnam's largest trading partner and a vital source of imports for its manufacturing sector, but the two communist countries have been for years embroiled in disputes in the South China Sea - the latest in May. Tensions have subsided somewhat more recently as Beijing's attention has focused on another claimant in the waterway, the Philippines. Vietnam and the United States elevated in September their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, the highest level in Vietnam's ranking, and announced closer cooperation on semiconductors and critical minerals during a visit to Hanoi by U.S. president Joe Biden. The United States, which is the top importer of Vietnam's goods, pushed for the upgrade as part of its strategy to secure uninterrupted access to global supply chains and to contain China in the South China Sea. Vietnam and Japan in November upgraded their relations to Vietnam's top tier during a visit by Vietnamese president Vo Van Thuong to Tokyo, agreeing to boost security and economic cooperation. Japanese multinationals, including Canon (7739.T), Honda (7267.T), Panasonic (6752.T) and Bridgestone (5108.T), are among the largest foreign investors in Vietnam. Vietnam and South Korea elevated their ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in December 2022 during a visit to Seoul by then Vietnamese president Nguyen Xuan Phuc, focusing on trade, investment, defence and security. South Korea is the largest source of foreign investment in Vietnam, with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) being the largest single foreign investor in the country where it assembles half its smartphones. In June the two countries signed 17 additional agreements, including on security and critical minerals during a visit to Vietnam by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Vietnam and the Vatican agreed in July to have the first post-war resident papal representative in Hanoi during a visit to meet Pope Francis by Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong. The representative was appointed in December. Home to nearly 7 million Catholics, Vietnam broke relations with the Vatican after the Communists took over the reunited country at the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. Talks to appoint a papal representative had started in 2009. Vietnam is part of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic union and has free trade deals with the European Union, Britain, Chile and South Korea. In July it added Israel to its list of free-trade partners. It is also a member of wider trade pacts, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes Canada, Australia and Mexico, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) which includes China and Japan."

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. officials have earmarked close to $30 billion in subsidies for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, aiming to bring cutting-edge artificial-intelligence chip development and manufacturing to American soil. But with money set to start flowing in the next few weeks, accomplishing that goal is far from certain, industry experts say. The Biden administration must weigh how much taxpayer money to allocate among Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2330.TW)  , a powerful foreign leader, and Intel (INTC.O)  , a beleaguered homegrown company whose turnaround efforts remain promising but untested. Betting on AI chips is also challenging in the rapidly evolving industry. Handing out subsidies today to the likes of Intel, TSMC or Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , which is also vying for federal dollars and is the only other firm in the world that can make advanced chips, does not guarantee security in the AI landscape of the future. \"AI itself is moving so quickly, if you focus on today's AI chips, maybe two years from now it's a whole different thing,\" said Jay Goldberg, chief executive of D2D Advisory, a finance and strategy consulting firm. \"As opposed to the (general) road map of advanced chipmaking which we know pretty clearly for the next decade.\" The money will come from the U.S. CHIPS Act, which passed in 2022. Intel, TSMC and Samsung are all building factories in the U.S. and are all likely to receive some degree of U.S. subsidies. The main question is how U.S. officials allocate the money to meet the goal of bolstering AI chip production. \"We don\u2019t manufacture or package any of the leading-edge AI chips needed to fuel the innovation ecosystem and power our most critical defense systems,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a speech last month. \"We cannot build the next generation of technological leadership on such a shaky foundation.\" The Commerce Department declined to comment. TSMC, the global leader in making AI chips, has yet to commit to bringing its most advanced technology to the United States. At the moment, TSMC manufactures chips for Nvidia (NVDA.O)  , Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O)  , Microsoft (MSFT.O)   and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O)   Google in Taiwan. The company is not expected to bring its advanced 3-nanometer manufacturing, which is already used to make iPhone 15 Pro chips, to Arizona until at 2027 or 2028, despite starting mass production in Taiwan last year. It has not disclosed any plans to bring 2-nanometer technology, which will start production next year in Taiwan, to the U.S. A TSMC spokesperson said the company has made \"steady progress in productive ongoing discussions with the U.S. government on inventive funding\" and its first factory in the U.S. \"will enable the leadership in the 5G and artificial intelligence era for decades.\" TSMC rival Samsung has a factory in Taylor, Texas, under construction that is expected to deploy the company's most advanced manufacturing technology. But according to analysts and industry sources, Samsung has long struggled to manufacture enough functional chips on each silicon wafer to make high- volume manufacturing profitable. In an emailed statement, Samsung referred Reuters to its fourth-quarter earnings call, where executives said its advanced manufacturing processes are mass-producing chips, and that orders for its AI accelerator chips are increasing. That leaves Intel (INTC.O)  , which has said it will carry out its most cutting-edge manufacturing processes - called \"18A\" and \"14A\" - in the U.S. But it has not publicly disclosed any major customers who plan to use the technology to make AI chips. Allocating a large chunk of CHIPS Act funding to Intel, which many analysts expect the U.S. government to do, is essentially a bet on Intel's turnaround plan that CEO Pat Gelsinger announced in early 2021 after taking over. Intel offers some advantages. AI chips are increasingly made up of smaller \"chiplets\" that must be packaged together, and Intel says it can combine chips made in its own factories with others fabricated by rivals such as TSMC. \"Their bias is that they're going to be the (manufacturer) of choice for these crazy complex systems of chips. And they're going to do that in the United States,\" said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of analyst firm Creative Strategies. But to become an AI chip powerhouse, Intel has the difficult task of retaking the manufacturing lead from TSMC. Then it must transform its business to a service-oriented contract manufacturer for outside customers. While recently unveiled Intel manufacturing technology looks promising on paper, the reality is that almost every advanced AI chip currently on the market is made by TSMC. \"The biggest issue they have is to execute,\" Dan Hutcheson, vice chair at analyst firm TechInsights, said of Intel. \"The whole foundry business is a good year or two away before they either make it or break it.\" An Intel spokesperson said in a statement that the company is on track with its \"18A\" process, which it expects to be \"manufacturing-ready\" in the second half of the year."

China's $36 billion search-engine operator lags artificial intelligence leaders like Microsoft (MSFT.O)  , but has made progress on its answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Yet its stock plunged 8% in New York trading on Wednesday despite decent results  . It now trades below 10 times forward earnings. Blame a wider rout in Chinese equities and overly high expectations. Quarterly results show the company is starting to monetise its AI bets. The numbers look promising: revenue from its flagship generative AI product, Ernie Bot, and the foundational model used to train it, topped 656 million yuan ($91 million) in the three months to the end of December. That's less than 2% of Baidu's top line, which primarily consists of advertising revenue, but boss Robin Li believes AI-related services will generate \"several billion\" yuan in incremental sales this year. To that end, Baidu is doing the right things. The company in November launched a paid version of Ernie Bot. It has also partnered with companies including Lenovo (0992.HK)   and Samsung (005930.KS)   to integrate AI apps into hardware. As of December, enterprise clients using its Ernie large language model stood at 26,000, up 150% from the same quarter the previous year. After the latest selloff, Baidu's New York shares have fallen by a quarter in 12 months. In contrast, OpenAI-backer Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O)   are both up over 50% over the same period, thanks to the global AI craze that has boosted stocks across the U.S., Europe and Japan. A selloff in Chinese equities is one factor, but even upstarts are attracting more excitement: Moonshot AI, a Chinese startup founded a year ago, recently raised over $1 billion at a $2.5 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported  . Baidu's current single-digit earnings multiple is far below its five-year average of 15 times. That implies shareholders are attributing very little, if any, value to its AI efforts. Li has his work cut out convincing investors Baidu deserves some AI love. Follow @mak_robyn   on X (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are their own.) CONTEXT NEWS Chinese search-engine operator Baidu on Feb. 28 reported revenue of 34.9 billion yuan ($4.9 billion) in the three months to Dec. 31, an increase of 6% year-on-year. Net income fell 48% to 2.6 billion yuan due to a one-off 3 billion yuan loss relating to the changes to the terms of the company's preferred stock.

For the three months through December, the company reported revenue of 34.95 billion yuan ($4.92 billion), a fraction under the analysts' average estimate of 34.97 billion yuan, according to LSEG data. As part of its efforts to monetize its AI services, Baidu announced in November the launch of a premium, paid version of its ChatGPT-like conversational AI product, Ernie Bot. The paid version charges 59.9 yuan per month. \"2023 marked a year of generative AI and foundation model...recently we began to generate incremental revenue from Ernie Bot,\" said company co-founder and CEO Robin Li in the earnings call. As China's largest internet search engine, Baidu generates most of its revenue from advertising. However, as China's economy slows and consumers spend less, Baidu has increasingly invested in AI. In March of last year, it launched a ChatGPT-like service to capitalize on the potential of the technology. Its large language model Ernie has since evolved to Ernie 4, which was unveiled in October and touted by the company as rivaling OpenAI's GPT-4. The company also aims to attract enterprise clients to its AI services. It told Reuters this month that it has partnered with Lenovo to feature its generative AI technology on Lenovo's smartphones. This followed similar deals to integrate its technology into smartphones from brands of Samsung and Honor. The number of enterprise clients that used its Ernie large language model in December reached 26,000, up 150% from the amount of the previous quarter, according to Li. The company specifically highlighted the contribution of Ernie-related services to its cloud computing business. Revenues from Ernie services were 656 million yuan in Q4, accounting for 7.8% of the total 8.4 billion yuan in sales recorded from the cloud computing business. In 2024, Li said AI-related services will generate several billion yuan in sales. The company's adjusted net income rose by 44% to 7.76 billion yuan, compared with 5.37 billion yuan for the same period a year earlier, beating analysts' forecasts for 6.32 billion yuan. Baidu's online marketing revenue grew 6% to 19.2 billion yuan. For the quarter, its adjusted profit was 21.86 yuan per American Depositary Share (ADS), compared with a profit of 15.25 yuan per share a year earlier. This exceeded analysts' average estimate of 17.87 yuan per ADS, according to LSEG. The U.S.-listed shares of the company were down by 6.5% on Wednesday morning. ($1 = 7.20 Chinese yuan renminbi)"

The planned award to the semiconductor packaging provider, an affliate of SKC Co, which in turn is part of South Korea's second-largest conglomerate SK Group (034730.KS), is to come from the U.S. government's $52.7 billion U.S. semiconductor chips manufacturing and subsidy fund. The funds will develop technology for advanced packaging, marking the first commercial facility to support the semiconductor supply chain with a new advanced material. The Commerce Department said the award will also support 1,000 construction jobs and 200 manufacturing and R&D jobs in Covington, Georgia. Absolics\u2019 glass substrate allows for processing and memory chips to be packed into a single device allowing for faster, more efficient computing. The company, which was created in 2021, broke ground on the Georgia plant in November 2022. Applied Materials (AMAT.O) is an investor. CEO Jun Rok Oh said in a statement the proposed funding will allow the company \"to fully commercialize our pioneering glass substrate technology for use in high-performance computing and cutting-edge defense applications.\" The Commerce Department said glass substrates from Absolics will be used to boost performance of leading-edge chips for AI and data centers. Last month, SK Hynix (000660.KS), the world's second-largest memory chip maker, said it would invest $3.87 billion to build an advanced packaging plant and R&D facility for AI products in Indiana. U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who previously noted the advanced packaging substrates market is currently concentrated in Asia, has made advanced packaging a priority and said last year \"the U.S. will develop multiple high-volume advanced packaging facilities.\" In November, the Commerce Department disclosed details of its plans to spend $3 billion in support of advanced packaging. The same month, Amkor Technology (AMKR.O) said it would spend $2 billion to build a new advanced packaging and test facility in Arizona that will package and test chips for Apple (AAPL.O) produced at a nearby Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) facility. That department recently announced several major proposed awards from the chips program including $8.5 billion in grants for Intel (INTC.O), $6.6 billion for TSMC, $6.4 billion for South Korea's Samsung (005930.KS) and $6.1 billion for memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O)."

        "content": "May 22 (Reuters) - Synopsys (SNPS.O)   raised its annual revenue and profit forecast on Wednesday in anticipation of robust demand for its software to design advanced chips driving artificial intelligence applications. The AI-boom has boosted investments in custom design of chips as tech firms are racing to dominate the lucrative technology with new innovations, triggering demand for companies such as Synopsys. Chief Executive Sassine Ghazi said demand for the company's core products remained strong, with revenue from them expected to grow 15% this year as customers design their own chips for AI and other purposes. Semiconductor firms continue to invest in research and design and turn to the company's AI-powered electronic design automation suite, Synopsys.ai, in a bid to ace and improve complex chip designs. The company raised its annual revenue forecast in a range of $6.09 billion to $6.15 billion, compared with its prior expectations of $6.06 billion to $6.12 billion. It now expects annual adjusted earnings per share between $12.90 and $12.98 from its earlier forecast of $12.86 and $12.94. Synopsys updated its annual expectations on its investor day in March, excluding   its software integrity (SIG) unit. Earlier this month, the company said it would sell the SIG unit to a private-equity group led by Clearlake Capital and Francisco Partners in a $2.1 billion deal. Synopsys forecast third-quarter revenue between $1.51 billion and $1.54 billion, below analysts' average estimate of $1.60 billion, according to LSEG data. Revenue in the second-quarter ended April 30 rose about 15% to $1.45 billion, but fell short of estimates of $1.53 billion. Excluding items, it earned $3.00 per share, beating estimates of $2.95 per share. In January, Synopsys, which partners with chipmakers including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)  , Intel (INTC.O)  , and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , said it would buy Ansys (ANSS.O)   in a $35 billion cash-and-stock deal. Separately, Ansys said on Wednesday that its stockholders approved   its proposed acquisition by Synopsys. Last week, Synopsys revealed   in a filing that it received a notice from China's State Administration for Market Regulation, asking it to report its planned acquisition of Ansys. Ghazi told Reuters that the deal falls below a threshold for notification to Chinese regulators, but those regulators have asked the company for its cooperation in examining the deal. \"At this stage we are in a assessment phase in terms of understanding from them why and what are the next steps we need to take,\" Ghazi told Reuters."

        "content": "May 21 (Reuters) - The PC just got an AI makeover, raising hopes that the buzzy technology would help revive an industry that has been on a steady decline over the last few years. Here's everything we know about AI PCs: Manufacturers say these devices process data more swiftly than traditional PCs and can handle a greater volume of AI tasks directly on the device, including chatbots. That means they do not have to rely on cloud data centers that currently power most AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT. Some models can even support the training of AI models, a task that requires significant computing power and is typically performed on servers. PC makers are hoping such features will help draw in buyers as more people lean on generative AI for everything from sending emails to planning vacations. Research firm Canalys estimates AI PC shipments will surpass 100 million in 2025, constituting 40% of all PCs shipped. AI PCs come with specialized processors called neural processing units (NPUs) that handle the majority of on-device AI workloads. These NPUs work in tandem with central processing units and graphics processors to manage complex tasks, deliver enhanced processing speeds and power applications such as AI assistants. Brands including Dell, HP (HPQ.N)  , Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , Lenovo (0992.HK)  , Asus and Acer have unveiled new computers under Microsoft's (MSFT.O)   Copilot+ branding, which was announced on Monday. Among these, Microsoft's refreshed Surface Laptop and Surface Pro tablet are some of the most affordable Copilot+ devices, starting at $999. Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6, expected to start at $1,699, stands as the priciest option based on the pricing disclosed by some manufacturers. A new flagship feature from Microsoft called \"recall\" has raised some privacy concerns. The Windows maker's Copilot+ PCs \"recall\" capability within the AI assistant allows it to search and retrieve information on any past activity on the computer. The recall feature tracks every action performed on the laptop from voice chats to web browsing, and creates a detailed history stored on the device. The user can then search this repository and go through past actions. Some social media users have expressed fears that the feature could enable spying, while billionaire technologist Elon Musk compared   it to \"Black Mirror,\" the Netflix series that explores the harmful effects of advanced technology. The main concern with the feature is whether the data is stored on the device or centrally, International Data Corp analyst Ryan O'Leary said, adding that there would be \"significant privacy risk\" if Microsoft stored the data. On the other hand, some experts say that managing more AI-related tasks directly on the device offers greater privacy. Research from Forrester showed AI PCs could help avoid the use of personal data to train AI systems, as well as copyright and patent violations, making them preferable for enterprise use."

Thomas Skordas was speaking at a conference in Antwerp about the future of the initiative, which is Europe's answer to similar programmes in the United States and Japan and to China's support for its domestic computer chip makers. The European Chips Act has led to \"promises for investments of the order of 100 billion euros to expand the manufacturing capacity within the EU by 2030\", Skordas said. The European Union Chips Act, billed as offering funding of 43 billion euros, relies heavily on individual governments with the Commission so far approving very little actual funding. However, firms including Intel (INTC.O) and TSMC (2330.TW) have announced plans to build plants in Germany at a cost of more than 30 billion euros this year. Skordas, an official at the Commission's digital unit, said the commission expects to finalise funding for R&D pilot lines in four sub-sectors of the chip industry by September, including a 2.5 billion euro grant for developing extremely advanced chips in Europe. Skordas said unspecified funding for another pilot line to develop photonics, or chips that use light instead of electricity, is still in the works. The Commission is also arranging funding for a European design platform to give companies, academics and startups access to the software tools needed to design their own chips. Most advanced chipmakers design chips but leave the manufacturing to specialists such as TSMC, Samsung (005930.KS) or Intel. \"In July, we expect to open the call for the consortium that will be responsible for designing and developing this platform at the European level,\" Skordas said.

        "content": "SEOUL, May 21 (Reuters) - Sixteen companies at the forefront of developing Artificial Intelligence pledged on Tuesday at a global meeting to develop the technology safely at a time when regulators are scrambling to keep up with rapid innovation and emerging risks. The companies included U.S. leaders Google (GOOGL.O)  , Meta (META.O)  , Microsoft (MSFT.O)   and OpenAI, as well as firms from China, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. They were backed by a broader declaration from the Group of Seven (G7) major economies, the EU, Singapore, Australia and South Korea at a virtual meeting hosted by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. South Korea's presidential office said nations had agreed to prioritise AI safety, innovation and inclusivity. \"We must ensure the safety of AI to ... protect the wellbeing and democracy of our society,\" Yoon said, noting concerns over risks such as deepfake. Participants noted the importance of interoperability between governance frameworks, plans for a network of safety institutes, and engagement with international bodies to build on agreement   at a first meeting to better address risks. Companies also committing to safety included Zhipu.ai, - backed by China's Alibaba (9988.HK)  , Tencent (0700.HK)  , Meituan (3690.HK)   and Xiaomi (1810.HK)   - UAE's Technology Innovation Institute, Amazon (AMZN.O)  , IBM (IBM.N)   and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  . They committed to publishing safety frameworks for measuring risks, to avoid models where risks could not be sufficiently mitigated, and to ensure governance and transparency. \"It's vital to get international agreement on the 'red lines' where AI development would become unacceptably dangerous to public safety,\" said Beth Barnes, founder of METR, a group promoting AI model safety, in response to the declaration. Computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, known as a \"godfather of AI\", welcomed the commitments but noted that voluntary commitments would have to be accompanied by regulation. Since November, discussion on AI regulation has shifted from longer-term doomsday scenarios to more practical concerns such as how to use AI in areas like medicine or finance, said Aidan Gomez, co-founder of large language model firm Cohere on the sidelines of the summit. China, which co-signed the \"Bletchley Agreement\" on collectively managing AI risks during the first November meeting, did not attend Tuesday's session but will attend an in-person ministerial session on Wednesday, a South Korean presidential official said. Tesla's Elon Musk, former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt, Samsung Electronics' Chairman Jay Y. Lee and other AI industry leaders participated in the meeting. The next meeting is to be in France, officials said."

        "content": "ANTWERP, Belgium, May 21 (Reuters) - The European chip industry should focus on bolstering its strengths as a research centre and crucial chipmaking equipment producer rather than trying to create a cutting edge chip manufacturer, the CEO of semiconductor research firm imec said. \"You can't make an advanced chip without European technology,\" Luc Van den Hove told reporters at the ITF World conference on Tuesday. He noted that the world's biggest equipment maker ASML (ASML.AS)   depended on German optics and imec research. Europe also houses smaller but crucial equipment companies such as ASM International (ASMI.AS)  . Earlier on Tuesday Belgium-based imec announced that it would host a 2.5-billion euro (2.72 billion) pilot line for researching future generations of chips that are more advanced than the 2 nanometre which is just entering production. But Van den Hove said that should not be seen as a prelude to any domestic European chip company or startup building its own 2-nanometre or better commercial plant such as Japanese firm Rapidus is attempting with government support. \"Whether we should build our own sub-two nanometre foundry, I have my doubts whether that makes sense to say it mildly,\" he said. Rather, Europe should continue to woo construction of such plants from the global big three logic chip manufacturers, TSMC (2330.TW)  , Intel (INTC.O)   and Samsung (005930.KS)  . Currently, only Intel has plans to build a major plant on European soil manufacturing better than 2 nanometre chips, in Magdeburg, Germany, though TSMC has plans for a less than 22 nanometre plant in Dresden - a \"legacy node\" or slightly older generation of technology in industry terms. Van den Hove said that Europe needed those too. \"We have to make sure that we avoid a shortage of legacy nodes, because in China, there's a lot of capacity being built up on legacy nodes,\" a potential geopolitical risk, he said. Europe also has strong legacy node chipmakers of its own, he said, naming NXP (NXPI.O)  , Infineon (IFXGn.DE)  , Bosch, and STMicroelectronics(STMPA.PA)   as \"all leaders in their specific segment\".

The European Union's 43 billion euro Chips Act was announced in 2023 to support domestic European chipmaking, a counterbalance to plans by China, the U.S. and other governments to shore up their own industries following shortages during the COVID pandemic. Leuven, Belgium-based research hub imec will host the pilot line for the sub-2 nanometre chips to help European industry, academics and start-ups access chip manufacturing technology that would otherwise be too expensive for any one of them to test or use in development. Top chipmakers such as TSMC (2330.TW)  , Intel (INTC.O)   and Samsung (005930.KS)   are launching 2 nanometre chips this year and next year in commercial plants, or fabs, costing as much as $20 billion euros. The European R&D line is intended to help develop future generations of even more advanced chips, and will be outfitted with equipment from European and global equipment and materials firms. \"The investment will allow us to double volumes and learning speed, accelerating our innovation pace, strengthening the European chip ecosystem, and driving economic growth in Europe.\u201d said imec CEO Luc Van den Hove in a statement. \"The NanoIC pilot line will support a diversity of industries in Europe, including automotive, telecommunications, health and others.\" Several EU programs and Belgium's Flanders government are providing 1.4 billion euros in funding, with industry players including leading equipment maker ASML (ASML.AS)   providing 1.1 billion euros, imec said. Other research laboratories participating include CEA-Leti of France, Fraunhofer of Germany, VTT of Finland, CSSNT of Romania and the Tyndall Institute of Ireland. Actual aid under the EU plan comes mostly from member states and has lagged money received in other regions, with only STMicroelectronics (STMPA.PA)   so far approved to receive 2.9 billion euros in aid from France for a plant in Crolles. Intel and TSMC are still awaiting EU approval for billions of euros in German state funding to begin building plants in Magdeburg and Dresden this year. ($1 = 0.9206 euros)"

        "content": "SEOUL, May 21 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   has replaced the chief of its semiconductor division in a bid to overcome a \"chip crisis\", amid a booming market for AI chips where the world's biggest memory chipmaker has lagged peers. The South Korean manufacturer on Tuesday said it has appointed Young Hyun Jun effective immediately, shifting him from the role as head of its future business planning unit. The move is likely aimed at catching up in the market for top-end chips used in artificial intelligence such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, an area where Samsung has fallen behind rivals such as SK Hynix (000660.KS)  , analysts said. \"This is a preemptive measure to strengthen future competitiveness by renewing the atmosphere internally and externally,\" Samsung said in a statement. Samsung's market share in DRAM chips used in tech devices reached 45.5% in the fourth quarter last year, according to data provider TrendForce. It lags, however, in the niche but increasingly important HBM chips segment where SK Hynix controls more than 90% of the mainstream HBM3 market. HBM3 is a fourth-generation HBM standard currently the most used for AI chipsets like those made by industry leader Nvidia (NVDA.O). Jun, 63, had led Samsung's memory chip business from 2014 to 2017 after working on the development of DRAM and flash memory chips. He was also the CEO of battery arm Samsung SDI (006400.KS) from 2017 to 2022, overseeing a U.S. electric vehicle battery joint venture with automaker Stellantis (STLAM.MI). \"We expect him to overcome the chip crisis with his management know-how he has accumulated,\" Samsung said. Kye Hyun Kyung, who had led the semiconductor division since 2022, will swap into Jun's prior role as head of its future business planning unit. Replacing such a high-ranking position in the middle of the year is unusual given most personnel changes at Samsung typically take place in the beginning of the year, analysts said. Samsung was late to respond to rapidly rising demand for memory chips used in AI chipsets, analysts said, with the specialised products being priced significantly higher, albeit making up a smaller portion of the DRAM market by shipments. \"The chip division has been lagging in competitiveness on various fronts, on high-density DRAM, its NAND products are no longer ahead of competition, and in foundry compared to TSMC,\" said analyst Lee Min-hee at BNK Investment & Securities, referring to Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), the world's top contract chipmaker. \"It also missed a lot of the global AI upward trend,\" Lee added. At Samsung's annual meeting in March, the former chip division head Kyung had insisted the manufacturer going forward could avoid making similar missteps in the HBM market. \"We're better prepared to prevent that from happening again in the future\", said Kyung, when answering a shareholder question on Samsung's recent setbacks in this area."

        "content": "May 20 (Reuters) - Soroban Capital Partners has built a stake in industrial firm Johnson Controls International (JCI.N)   in the wake of pressure from Elliott Investment Management, Bloomberg News reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. A New York-based hedge fund, Soroban has invested more than $500 million, making it one of the company's top 20 shareholders, according to the report. A day earlier, activist investor Elliott had taken a more than $1 billion position in the company, it had reported on Sunday, adding that Elliott's intentions could not immediately be learned. Johnson Controls did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Soroban and Elliott declined to comment. Shares of Johnson Controls were up about 0.4% in after the bell on Monday. The stock has gained nearly 20% this year, giving the company a market value of $46.5 billion as of Friday's close. Founded in 1885, Johnson Controls makes a wide range of appliances and equipment for commercial buildings, as well as home comfort appliances. It provides electronic systems for offices, schools and hospitals in areas such as ventilation, security and fire detection. The company has been attempting to divest its portfolio of heating and ventilation assets (HVAC) as part of efforts to streamline its business. Robert Bosch GmbH, Lennox International (LII.N) and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) were among industrial firms competing to acquire the HVAC assets worth over $6 billion, Reuters had earlier reported. Johnson Controls is also considering the sale of its ADT alarms business unit, which operates in Europe and Latin America, sources told Reuters earlier this month, adding the unit had already drawn interest from private equity funds. The company earlier this month forecast third-quarter profit below Wall Street estimates, even as steady residential construction demand helped drive an earnings beat for the second quarter ended March 31. Elliott, one of the world's most prominent investors, is known for pushing for changes at companies to boost shareholder returns. Some of its recent activist campaigns include at U.S. telecommunications infrastructure firm Crown Castle (CCI.N) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N)."

It was not immediately clear when the therapies would be launched. Regeneron has filed lawsuits against companies such as Amgen (AMGN.O) and Biocon, which are seeking to bring Eylea biosimilars to the U.S. market. Regeneron recorded U.S. sales of $5.72 billion from its regular 2 milligram (mg) dose of Eylea last year, but the drug faces pressure from rivals including Roche's (ROG.S) Vabysmo as well as a looming biosimilar threat. Regeneron had flagged in its 2023 annual report that it might lose market exclusivity for Eylea on May 17 this year. To counter those challenges, Regeneron has been focusing on Eylea's higher 8 mg dose, which recorded sales of $200 million in the first quarter. Biocon Biologics is a unit of Indian drugmaker Biocon (BION.NS), while Samsung Bioepis is owned by Samsung Biologics (207940.KS). Regeneron, Samsung Bioepis, Biocon and Biogen did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment."

The potential thinner version is likely to be priced higher than Apple's iPhone Pro Max, and is expected to be launched with the iPhone 17 in September 2025, the report said. The Cupertino, California-based company is still testing different designs for the device, code-named D23, that could have Apple's latest-generation processor, likely called A19, the report added. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The expected revamp underscores Apple's need to spruce up the iPhone, the company's most popular product, as it grapples with tough competition from Honor and Huawei in China and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) globally. Samsung had the largest share of the smartphone market in the first three months of 2024 with 20.8%, followed by Apple's 17.3% market share, according to research firm International Data Corporation. For the fiscal second quarter, Apple's iPhone sales fell 10.5% to $45.96 billion. Apple also plans to drop its less expensive model iPhone Plus and intends to launch a cheaper iPhone, a successor to its iPhone SE in the spring of 2025, the report said. The news come days after Apple unveiled its latest iPad Pro with a new chip for artificial intelligence computing as it rushes to catch up with its Big Tech rivals in a race to dominate the emerging technology."

        "content": "May 16 (Reuters) - Applied Materials (AMAT.O)   forecast third-quarter results above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, following strong demand for its semiconductor tools, but failed to meet lofty investor expectations. The company's shares, which have rallied about 32% so far this year, fell about 1.2% in extended trading. Applied Materials has benefited from growing demand for wafer fabrication equipment, which are sophisticated and expensive machinery to make semiconductors, as its customers are investing heavily to produce artificial intelligence chips. \"Investors are nudging the share price down because they were looking for a more solid beat and outlook,\" Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital said, adding that the results do not knock \"the wind out of a semiconductor chip recovery theme\". A surge in the requirement of high-performance computing and data centers has also driven demand for memory semiconductors such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory, helping chip tools suppliers. Applied Materials forecast third-quarter revenue of about $6.65 billion, plus or minus $400 million, compared with analysts' estimates of $6.58 billion, according to LSEG data. The company expects third-quarter adjusted profit per share between $1.83 and $2.19, compared with estimates of $1.98. Applied Materials, which supplies chipmaking tools to Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)  , reported that 43% of its total revenue came from China in the second quarter. End markets are mixed with weak industrial and auto markets, but strong image sensors, power chips, microcontrollers and other markets, Applied Materials Chief Financial Officer Brice Hill said on a post-earnings call. The company, which is the largest semiconductor equipment maker in the United States, reported second-quarter revenue of $6.65 billion, beating estimates of $6.54 billion. On an adjusted basis, Applied Materials earned $2.09 per share, compared with estimates of $1.99."

Representatives for Dell did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment and more information, including on whether a settlement had been reached. A Caltech spokesperson declined to comment. Caltech previously won a $1.1 billion jury verdict against Apple (AAPL.O) and Broadcom (AVGO.O) in a dispute over some of the same patents, though a U.S. appeals court later ordered a retrial on the damages amount. The Pasadena, California university has since settled that case as well as related lawsuits against Samsung [RIC:RIC:SMELA.UL], Microsoft (MSFT.O), and HP (HPQ.N). Caltech sued Round Rock, Texas-based Dell in 2020, alleging that Wi-Fi technology in the company's laptops, desktops and other products infringed the school's patents. Dell asked the court in February to dismiss the case, arguing that the university failed to establish that its products could have infringed. The case is California Institute of Technology v.

        "content": "HONG KONG, May 15 (Reuters) - Huawei is revamping its retail strategy and aggressively opening flagship stores in China, with some just a stone's throw away from Apple (AAPL.O) shops, as it seeks to retake the premium electronics throne in the world's biggest smartphone market. Situated directly across from Apple's Shanghai flagship store, Huawei's recently renovated shop spans three floors of a famous heritage architecture building in the financial hub's busy shopping district and includes a coffee shop and a gym. Huawei opened four such stores in major Chinese cities between December and February, an aggressive marketing blitz by a company that had largely relied on licensed distributors and is rebounding from U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 that had crippled its smartphone business for four years until it could source domestic replacement parts. \"The Huawei flagship store is very nice. It looks much brighter inside compared to the Apple Store across the street,\" said Amy Chen, a 27-year-old physiotherapist who visited the Shanghai store this week to switch to Huawei's top-end Pura 70 Ultra from the iPhone 15 Pro in hopes of better mobile reception. Apple has 47 stores in mainland China. Huawei, which did not open a flagship store until 2019, now has 11 of them. \"I think they will open more than 20 of them. Then it will eventually catch up to Apple,\" said Ethan Qi, associate director at research firm Counterpoint. It marks a stark contrast to 2021 when the company's licensed stores were shuttered across China due to product shortages caused by the U.S. sanctions. Huawei has since developed its own chips, introduced highly popular 5G-capable products and, according to sources, has started aggressively recruiting dealers in recent months. \"As Huawei now manages to ship in large quantities, given the good profit margin they could provide, (distributors) have become willing to purchase Huawei devices again,\" Qi said. \"Previously, many couldn't get stock and their 4G devices didn't sell well.\" Huawei has been actively bargaining with distributors, touting the above industry average profit margins of its phones and sometimes demanding exclusionary clauses to turn them into its exclusive partners, according to two industry sources. More than 5,200 stores licensed to sell Huawei products sprang up through the first 10 months of 2023, with more than half of them in third and fourth-tier cities, according to market research firm GeoQ, helping Huawei expand its army of distribution partners nationwide. Its renewed marketing push poses a major challenge to Apple, which suffered a 6.6% plunge in iPhone sales in China to 10.8 million in the first quarter, according to IDC data. By contrast, Huawei boosted its smartphone shipments by 110% to 11.7 million in the first quarter and overtook Apple as the No.2 smartphone vendor in China. Huawei and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Lucas Zhong, an analyst at research firm Canalys, said Huawei had plans to build out its flagship stores since 2020 but the progress was slowed by the U.S. sanctions, which led to a much slower iteration of its high-end products. There are still supply chain issues leading to shortages of specific models, but they are under much better control and the new phones are garnering good reviews. That means Huawei is now putting its focus squarely on selling premium products that compete with Apple, according to analysts. Its latest Pura 70 Ultra smartphone, for example, starts at 9,999 yuan ($1,300), matching the price tag of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, while Samsung (005930.KS) and Xiaomi (1810.HK) are keeping prices for their premium models lower amid soft market demand. Huawei's luxurious flagship stores display premium products ranging from smartphones to tablets, smartwatches, televisions and even electric vehicles made in partnership with Chinese automakers. \"Huawei now has a long product line,\" Qi said. \"They need big demo areas\u2026 They will have to do it themselves because their distributors don't have the capability to rent such a massive area.\" The push to build more of its own stores also underscores Huawei's heavy reliance on offline sales. Between 70% and 80% of Huawei's sales come from physical stores, while Apple sees about 40% of its sales coming from online, according to Toby Zhu, another analyst at Canalys. \"Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are all being affected (by Huawei's comeback),\" Zhu said, referring to other Chinese smartphone makers. \"But for now, the biggest impact has been on Apple.\" And the impact is beginning to be felt beyond mainland China. Simon Lam, owner of a popular smartphone shop named Trinity Electronics in Hong Kong, said more independent smartphone shops had started selling Huawei devices in recent months. \"Everybody is stocking up on some Huawei right now. Some more, some less,\" he said. \"People are willing to pay a lot of money for high-end Huawei, something other brands really can't compare with.\" ($1 = 7.2259 Chinese yuan renminbi)"

        "content": "SINGAPORE/BEIJING, May 15 (Reuters) - Two Chinese chipmakers are in the early stages of producing high bandwidth memory (HBM) semiconductors used in artificial intelligence chipsets, according to sources and documents. The progress in HBM - even if only in older versions of HBM - represents a major step forward in China's efforts to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers amid tensions with Washington that have led to restrictions on U.S. exports of advanced chipsets to Chinese firms. CXMT, China's top manufacturer of DRAM chips, has developed sample HBM chips in partnership with chip packaging and testing company Tongfu Microelectronics (002156.SZ), according to three people briefed on the matter. The chips are being shown to clients, two of them said. Tongfu Microelectronics' shares surged 8% in Wednesday trade. In another example, Wuhan Xinxin is building a factory that will be able to produce 3,000 12-inch HBM wafers a month with construction slated to have begun in February this year, documents from corporate database Qichacha show. CXMT and other Chinese chip firms have also been holding regular meetings with South Korean and Japanese semiconductor equipment firms to buy tools to develop HBM, said two of the people. The sources were not authorised to speak on the matter and declined to be identified. Hefei-based CXMT or ChangXin Memory Technologies and Tongfu Microelectronics did not respond to requests for comment. Wuhan Xinxin, which has flagged to regulators that it is interested in going public, and its parent company did not respond to requests for comment. The parent company is also the parent of NAND memory specialist YMTC or Yangtze Memory Technologies. YMTC said it did not have the capability to mass produce HBM. Both CXMT and Wuhan Xinxin are private companies which have received local government funding to advance technologies as China pours capital into developing its chip sector. Wuhan's local government also did not respond to requests for comment. Separately, Chinese tech behemoth Huawei (HWT.UL) - which the U.S. has deemed a national security threat and is subject to sanctions - is aiming to produce HBM2 chips in partnership with other domestic companies by 2026, according to one of the sources and a separate person with knowledge of the matter. The Information reported in April that a Huawei-led group of companies aiming to make HBM includes Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit, a memory chip maker also under U.S. sanctions. Huawei, which has seen demand soar for its Ascend AI chips, declined to comment. It is not clear where Huawei procures HBM. Fujian Jinhua did not respond to a request for comment. HBM - a type of DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption - is ideal for processing massive amounts of data produced by complex AI applications and demand has soared amid the AI boom. The market for HBM is dominated by South Korea's SK Hynix (000660.KS) - until recently the sole HBM supplier to AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA.O) according to analysts - as well as Samsung (005930.KS), and to a lesser extent U.S. firm Micron Technology . All three manufacture the latest standard - HBM3 chips - and are working to bring fifth-generation HBM or HMB3E to customers this year. China's efforts are currently focused on HBM2, according to two of the sources and a separate person with direct knowledge of the matter. The U.S. has not put restrictions on exports of HBM chips per se but HBM3 chips are made using American technology that many Chinese firms including Huawei are barred from accessing as part of the curbs. Nori Chiou, an investment director at White Oak Capital and a former analyst who looked at the IT sector, estimates that Chinese chipmakers lag their global rivals by a decade in HBM. \"China faces a considerable journey ahead, as it currently lacks the competitive edge to rival its Korean counterparts even in the realm of traditional memory markets,\" he said. \"Nonetheless, (CXMT's) collaboration with Tongfu represents a significant opportunity for China to advance its capabilities in both memory and advanced packaging technologies within the HBM market.\" Patents filed by CXMT, Tongfu and Huawei indicate that plans to develop HBM domestically date back at least three years when China's chip industry increasingly became the target of U.S. export controls. CXMT has filed almost 130 patents in the United States, China, and Taiwan for different technical issues related to the manufacturing and functionalities of HBM chips, according to Anaqua's AcclaimIP database. Of those, 14 were published in 2022, 46 in 2023, and 69 in 2024. One Chinese patent, published last month, shows the company is looking at advanced packaging techniques like hybrid bonding to create a more powerful HBM product. A separate filing shows that CXMT is also investing in developing technology needed to create HBM3."

        "content": "WASHINGTON, May 13 (Reuters) - Polar Semiconductor is set to receive a $120 million U.S. government grant to expand its plant in Minnesota, which will allow the company to double its U.S. production capacity of sensor and power chips within two years. The award, part of the Biden administration's $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and research subsidy program, follows an agreement by Polar's current owners to sell down their stakes to U.S. private equity firms so that the company can become majority U.S.-owned. The Commerce Department, which made the grant, noted shortages of power and sensor chips were a key issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupting many sectors. Under Secretary of Commerce Laurie Locascio said Polar's \"technology plays a critical role in high-voltage applications across the aerospace, automotive, and defense sectors and this proposed investment would enable new capabilities to manufacture the next generation of semiconductors.\" The state of Minnesota is also contributing $75 million to the $525 million project. Polar is currently 70% owned by Sanken Electric (6707.T)   and 30% held by Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM.O)  . Last month Sanken said that Niobrara Capital and Prysm Capital plan to invest $175 million for around 59% of Polar. Sanken's holding will drop to around 30% and Allegro's stake will fall to around 10%. The Biden administration has announced seven other planned awards including up to $6.4 billion in grants to South Korea's Samsung (005930.KS)   to expand chip production in central Texas. Intel (INTC.O)   won $8.5 billion in grants in March while Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW)   clinched $6.6 billion last month to build out its American production. The Commerce Department also said last month it plans to award memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O)   $6.1 billion to help fund domestic chip factory projects. More awards are expected this year. All the awards have yet to be finalized and amounts could change after the Commerce Department conducts due diligence."

        "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - ASML (ASML.AS)   is a monopoly in the true sense of the word. The $360 billion Dutch company faces no meaningful competition selling machines that manufacture the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors. But as new Chief Executive Christophe Fouquet takes over, his predecessor Peter Wennink leaves behind challenges as well as strengths. ASML plays a critical role in the semiconductor supply chain, which itself is key to the data centre boom underpinning the expansion of artificial intelligence. The Veldhoven-headquartered company is the sole provider of lithography machines using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light. These enable chipmakers to draw more intricate transistor designs a few nanometres wide on microchip wafers, allowing the likes of Apple\u2019s (AAPL.O)   iPhone to become ever more sophisticated. When Wennink took over in 2013, two major developments helped him see off competitors like Japan\u2019s Nikon (7731.T)   and Canon (7751.T)  . ASML had just received the chunky funding it needed to harvest sufficient quantities of EUV light: in 2012 U.S. group Intel (INTC.O)  , Taiwan\u2019s TSMC (2330.TW)   and South Korea\u2019s Samsung, the world\u2019s top three chipmakers, collectively pumped   3.9 billion euros of cash into the Dutch group in return for an aggregate 23% stake. Second, ASML bought well. Wennink paid   $3.1 billion in 2016 to acquire Hermes Microvision, a Taiwanese company that builds equipment using electrons to identify microscopic defects. That played a key role in boosting EUV machine efficiency. The upshot, in 2024, is that ASML is the only company globally that can manufacture machines capable of reliably carving cost-effective and more precise chips. Accordingly, the Dutch firm\u2019s market capitalisation has risen ninefold from under $40 billion in 2013. Revenue jumped five times from 5.2 billion euros in 2013 to 27.6 billion euros last year. Wennink also managed to churn out more profit from its cutting-edge EUV machines. ASML\u2019s gross profit margin grew from 41% in 2013 to 51% in 2023. Fouquet, who joined ASML in 2008, therefore seems to have it made. A third of ASML\u2019s 2023 sales came from EUVs, on which the group has a total order book of 38 billion euros as of March. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect the segment to contribute half the group\u2019s revenue by 2030, which will have more than doubled from 2023 to 57 billion euros. The more EUVs Fouquet sells, the more the company\u2019s profitability improves: ASML guided a 54% to 56% gross profit margin for 2025. Last year the group also shipped the first of its new \u201chigh numerical aperture (NA)\u201d EUV machines, which cut production times and cost 350 million euros apiece. But there are also headaches. One live one is rising tensions between China and the United States. The Biden administration has aggressively tried to stop Beijing accessing cutting-edge and mid-range chips. It also prevents Chinese customers from receiving the equipment or software necessary to make such chips, which is why ASML has never been able to sell its most advanced EUV machines to China. The U.S. is trying to tighten the screw. Washington wants the Dutch to impose controls on a broader set of hardware which could include its less advanced deep ultraviolet (DUV) machines, and even prevent ASML from serving Chinese customers who have already acquired DUV machines. Given ASML has around 1,600 staff locally in China it\u2019s unclear how either government can stop the company from doing so. But Fouquet has a special reason to keep the U.S. happy. One of the core reasons ASML can churn out advanced machines at scale is because of its capacity to adeptly handle its supply chain. Just 15% of its lithography machines, for example, are built from components built in-house: the vast majority come from other firms. But while 80% of its 5,100 suppliers are based in Europe, ASML still counts 13% from North America, with the remainder in Asia. Any supplier snafu \u2013 politically motivated or otherwise \u2013 could slow down ASML\u2019s ability to ship machines to its customers. Another issue for Fouquet is the increasing difficulty of attracting sufficiently qualified people. By 2030, the number of engineering graduates entering the semiconductor industry would need to quadruple to fill the headcount required in Europe alone, McKinsey researchers reckon. The Dutch government is admittedly spending $2.7 billion on improving infrastructure in the Eindhoven region, where ASML is based, partly to help the company attract and retain talent. But the AI boom has prompted a rise in demand for engineers who write and build AI models. The scope for greater prestige, and possibly better compensation, mean that Big Tech groups like Meta Platforms (META.O)  , Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL.O)   and Microsoft (MSFT.O)   could easily steal new talent from under Fouquet\u2019s nose. The final risk is that ASML rests on its laurels, as game-changers like AI sweep the technology sector. Right now, Fouquet has a comforting moat around his business \u2013 if the likes of Nikon or Canon wanted to build a better machine than ASML\u2019s EUV they\u2019d need epic capital investment, plus years to train up a sales force to use the new kit, plus a quorum of customers willing to take a long-term bet on a new option. But it\u2019s far from impossible an as-yet-unidentified way to short-circuit that process emerges, creating a cheaper and speedier path to an ASML-killer. The net effect of all these headaches for Fouquet may be something relatively prosaic: a bumpy top line. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha expect revenue from the most cutting-edge high NA EUV machines to only amount to 2.6 billion euros by 2030, just 4.5% of the group total. And estimates compiled by the same source anticipate revenue growth from the lower-tech DUV machines to slow to 4% in 2026 and to remain under 10% in the following four years. But even then the segment will still make up a quarter of group sales, and Chinese tensions could make things worse. Meanwhile consultant Bain has flagged the risk that chipmakers gorge on EUVs in the next few years, creating a boom that\u2019s then followed by a few years of meagre orders. ASML shares are still up over 40% from a year ago, partly because U.S. subsidies are encouraging TSMC and Intel to ramp up EUV-dependent semiconductor facilities. Yet first-quarter results gave a flavour of its potential future volatility \u2013 ASML dropped 7% on April 17 on underwhelming EUV order numbers. At nearly 30 times expected EBITDA this year, its shares might slump if stuttering revenue growth becomes a pattern. Fouquet may preside over a monopoly, but that also means investors may hold him to a higher standard.

        "content": "WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's bid to draw Vietnam closer as a strategic ally clashed with his desire for union workers' votes on Wednesday as trade lawyers sparred over whether the Commerce Department should upgrade the communist-ruled country to market economy status. The move, opposed by U.S. steelmakers, Gulf Coast shrimpers and American honey farmers, but backed by retailers and some other business groups, would reduce the punitive anti-dumping duties set on Vietnamese imports because of its current status as a non-market economy marked by heavy state influence. Vietnam's deepening economic ties to China loomed large in arguments on both sides of the issue at a virtual public hearing hosted by the Commerce Department as part of a review and decision due on July 26. Steptoe LLP attorney Eric Emerson, representing Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade, said Vietnam should be graduated to market economy status because it has satisfied the six criteria used by the Commerce Department to judge whether countries have a market-driven economy, from currency convertibility and labor rights to investment openness and resource allocation. \"Vietnam has demonstrated that its performance on these statutory factors is as good, or often better, than other countries that have previously been granted market economy status,\" he said, citing less government support for state firms than India and more openness to foreign investment than Indonesia, Canada and the Philippines. Vietnam has argued it should be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, saying retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China. During Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, the two countries elevated ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has promoted Vietnam as a \"friend-shoring\" destination to shift U.S. supply chains away from China. Upgrade proponent Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   has become one of the biggest employers in Vietnam because of the country's market-oriented changes, the South Korean firm's U.S public policy head Scott Thompson told the hearing. \"Vietnam has emerged as a stable, secure supply chain partner of the United States ... to the ultimate benefit of the U.S. economy,\" Thompson said. But opponents of upgrading Vietnam - one of 12 economies labeled by Washington as non-market, including China, Russia, North Korea and Azerbaijan - argued that Hanoi's policy commitments have not been matched by concrete actions and it operates as a planned economy governed by the ruling Communist Party. They also said Vietnam's industries are highly dependent on investment and imports of inputs from China, many of which are already subject to U.S. anti-dumping duties. Jeffrey Gerrish, a former Trump administration trade official representing Steel Dynamics Inc (STLD.O)  , said upgrading would unleash a flood of unfairly traded imports from Vietnam, which he said had become a platform for circumvention of U.S. tariffs by China. \"Rather than countering Chinese influence, any such action would serve as a gift to China and Chinese interests,\" Gerrish said. Biden has heavily courted union votes in the looming November presidential election, particularly from steelworkers in the swing state of Pennsylvania. He has opposed Nippon Steel's (5401.T)   proposed takeover of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel (X.N)  , and called for sharply higher Section 301 tariffs on imports of Chinese steel. At the heart of the Commerce decision is whether to continue the higher tariff rates on Vietnamese goods in anti-dumping cases involving non-market economies. U.S. anti-dumping duties on Vietnamese frozen farmed shrimp are currently 25.76%, while similar duties on shrimp from Thailand, a market economy, are only 5.34%. Assertions of Vietnam's lawyers that rising Vietnamese wages are the result of labor-management bargaining also came under challenge. Human Rights Watch said Vietnam did not meet basic labor rights standards required for reclassification and that it was false to say that Vietnamese workers can organize unions or that their wages are the result of free bargaining. \"Vietnam's Trade Union Law only allows government-controlled 'unions,'\" it said in a statement after the hearing. Nazak Nikakhtar, a former Commerce Department official in the Trump administration now with the Wiley Rein law firm, said Hanoi employed the same oppressive policies and predatory economic practices as China and was likely to side with its powerful next-door neighbor over the U.S. Emerson, the lawyer representing Hanoi, said denial of market economy status would push Vietnam closer to China."

The U.S. is trying to wean the electric vehicle battery chain away from China through its Inflation Reduction Act which is being closely monitored by automakers as they make investment decisions. South Korea's industry ministry said it will continue to seek to secure key battery materials so domestic battery manufacturers and carmakers can maintain their competitiveness in the U.S. market by meeting the requirements of the Inflation Reduction Act. \"In the case of graphite, it was difficult to diversify the supply chain in a short period of time, making it difficult to receive U.S. EV tax credits for batteries ... we have been actively consulting with the U.S. government, and our request (of extension of graphite use) was reflected in the final rules,\" the industry ministry said in a statement. The ministry said South Korean battery makers, including LG Energy Solution (373220.KS), Samsung SDI (006400.KS) and SK On that attended the meeting, welcomed the reprieve. The new rules now let car buyers get up to $7,500 in tax credits for electric vehicles (EV) containing Chinese graphite through 2026. The ministry added that it would provide 9.7 trillion won ($7.11 billion) in financial aid to support efforts of the country's EV sector to secure a self-sufficient supply chain. Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would give automakers until 2027 to reduce some hard-to-trace minerals like graphite contained in anode materials and critical minerals contained in electrolyte salts, binders, and additives. The Industry Ministry said it will help companies meet requirements such as submitting plans to the U.S. on how they will diversify graphite supplies from 2027 and make \u201caccurate calculations\u201d of the values of battery minerals to receive tax credits.

An ASML spokesperson confirmed the CFO had spoken at a Jefferies-hosted call with investors. ASML's shares rose 6.3% to 927.10 euros ($1,008.78) by 1314 GMT. ASML, the world's biggest semiconductor equipment maker, makes lithography tools, which use beams of light to help create the minute circuitry of computer chips, while TSMC (2330.TW)   is the world's biggest maker of advanced chips. The Jefferies report said Dassen \"sounded optimistic\" that commercial talks with TSMC were nearing conclusion, with \"significant\" 2 nm-related orders coming through, starting in Q2 or Q3. ASML has previously said it targets 2025 sales in the 30-40 billion euro range, helped by booming demand for cutting-edge logic chips used in smartphones and for AI. The Jefferies report said the company sees demand continuing to be strong into 2026, helped by government-subsidised factories being built around the world. The report said TSMC expects to receive one of ASML's new High NA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines, which cost more than 350 million euros each, sometime this year. Intel was the first to purchase one of the machines, with the other installed in an ASML-Imec laboratory that opened this week. ASML has orders for more than a dozen of the High NA tools from all the customers who use its current EUV line, which includes: Intel, TSMC, Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron. The Jefferies report also said ASML does not believe it will face competition in EUV technology from either Chinese lithography company SMEE or Huawei \"in the foreseeable future due to the complexity of the technology itself as well as the ecosystem.\" ($1 = 0.9190 euros)"

        "content": "AMSTERDAM, June 3 (Reuters) - ASML (ASML.AS)  , the biggest maker of equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, said on Monday it has opened a test laboratory for its High NA EUV lithography equipment, together with Belgium chip research firm Imec. The laboratory in Veldhoven, Netherlands, years in the making, will give leading chipmakers and other equipment and materials supply companies an early chance to work with the 350 million euro ($380 million) tool, the first of its kind. ASML dominates the market for lithography equipment, a central step in the chipmaking process in which beams of light are used to create the circuitry of chips. Among chip manufacturers, only TSMC, Samsung, Intel and memory specialists SK Hynix and Samsung are able to manufacture using ASML's current generation of extreme ultraviolet or EUV machines. The new High NA tool allows for up to 60% better resolution, and is expected to lead to new generations of smaller, faster chips. ASML repeated on Monday that it expects customers to begin commercial manufacturing with the tool in 2025-2026. To date ASML has only shipped one other test machine, to Intel in the United States, which plans to use the tool in its 14A process in 2025. ASML has orders for more than a dozen, though TSMC, its biggest customer for EUV equipment, has said it does not need to use High NA tools for its A16 chips, expected to enter production in 2025.

        "published_time": "2024-05-30T12:06:20.352Z",
        "content": "NEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOGL.O)   Google and augmented reality startup Magic Leap are forming a strategic technology partnership and working on building immersive experiences that blend the physical and digital worlds. Magic Leap said in a blog post on Thursday that the two companies have agreed to a partnership. A Google spokesperson confirmed the agreement. While short on details, the announcement adds to signals that Google may be plotting a return to the market for augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies that it so far has largely yielded to rivals Meta (META.O)   and Apple (AAPL.O)  . The partnership would combine Florida-based Magic Leap's expertise in optics and device manufacturing with Google's technology platforms, Magic Leap said. \"We've shipped a couple of different versions of augmented reality devices so far, so we're out there delivering things, and Google has a long history of platforms thinking,\" Magic Leap's Chief Technology Officer Julie Larson-Green told Reuters in an interview ahead of the announcement. \"So we're thinking, putting our expertise and their expertise together, there's lots of things we could end up doing,\" she said. Google is an investor in Magic Leap, which is majority owned by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The startup was an early darling in the AR headset space, but struggled to find a consumer niche and more recently started exploring arrangements to license its technology or produce components for others. Magic Leap and Google both declined to say whether the partnership was expected to yield a consumer AR device. Google also has been collaborating with Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   since early last year to develop mixed reality technologies, which the Google spokesman said was unchanged by the deal with Magic Leap. Larson-Green said she was especially eager to work with some of the \"cool AI tie-ins\" with augmented reality that Google announced at its annual developer conference earlier this month. In a video at that event, Google showed off an AI agent called Project Astra by having someone don a glasses prototype and ask the agent questions about what that person was seeing. The agent gave answers in both audio form and as digital text overlaid on the lenses. That functionality is similar to what Meta is planning for its Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which added an AI assistant last year and in April received a software update enabling the agent to identify objects seen by the wearer in audio form. If Google were to jump back into making AR glasses, it would be yet another dramatic twist in the company's on-again, off-again relationship with the technology. Google was a first mover in what it pitched as an AR revolution more than a decade ago, when it introduced its Google Glass smart glasses. Its enthusiasm then was so great that it unveiled the device in an elaborate 2012 demo involving skydivers using the glasses to live stream a jump on to a San Francisco building. However, consumers recoiled at the product's clunky design and privacy concerns, to the point that those who wore it were sometimes called \"glassholes.\" Google retreated from the consumer market in 2015 and later abandoned the enterprise market as well. Two years ago, though, the company came back with a preview of a new set of glasses that it said would display real-time translations of conversations in English, Mandarin, Spanish and American Sign Language. The future of that project was thrown into doubt in January, when Google laid off hundreds of employees in its hardware units, including the majority of its AR team."

The Seoul High Court found Chey's shares in holding company SK Inc (034730.KS)   should be counted as part of the couple's joint property, overturning a 2022 ruling by a lower court for a much smaller amount. Chey was ordered on Thursday to pay 1.38 trillion won ($1 billion) in cash and 2 billion won in alimony to Roh Soh-yeong, the daughter of former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo. Chey's lawyers said he will appeal. Shares in SK Inc jumped 9% after the ruling, giving it a market value of some 2 trillion won. Chey owns 17.7% of the SK Inc and controls SK Hynix (000660.KS)  , the world's second-largest memory chip maker, and other SK affiliates through his stake in SK Inc. Park Ju-gun, head of corporate analysis firm Leaders Index, said that since the court ruling did not stipulate that Chey split his stock holding with Roh, he thought the chances of increased purchases of SK Inc stock were low. He also said that, assuming the ruling stands, he thought Chey would be unlikely to sell his shares to make the payment but would probably take out loans using his SK Inc stock as collateral. SK Group is South Korea's second-largest conglomerate in terms of assets after Samsung, according to the country's Fair Trade Commission. ($1 = 1,378.59 won)"

The South Korean tech giant has fallen behind rivals SK Hynix (000660.KS) and Micron Technology (MU.O) in high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips which are in high demand for use in AI processors. Citing a \"chip crisis\", it replaced its semiconductor chief this month with Young Hyun Jun, who led Samsung's memory chip business from 2014 to 2017 after working on the development of DRAM and flash memory chips. \"This (AI era) poses a great challenge to us, but if we take the right direction and respond, it can become an unprecedented new opportunity,\" Jun, 63, said in a May 30 letter to staff which was seen by Reuters. Samsung's latest HBM chips have yet to pass Nvidia's (NVDA.O) tests for use in the U.S. firm's AI processors due to heat and power consumption problems, three people briefed on the issues have said. Samsung said in response that \"claims of failing due to heat and power consumption are not true,\" and that testing was \"proceeding smoothly and as planned.\" Its weakness in HBM has been noticed by investors. While shares in SK Hynix and Micron have both surged some 80% over the past year, Samsung's shares are up just 6%. Thursday's letter also noted that Samsung's semiconductor division last year recorded its largest loss since the company was founded, that its foundry business has not been able to narrow the gap with a leading firm and that its system LSI business was also struggling. A Samsung union has also threatened to stage the company's first walkout next week, calling for more transparency in pay as well as additional annual leave."

        "content": "May 29 (Reuters) - Arm Holdings (O9Ty.F)   on Wednesday unveiled new chip blueprints and software tools to help smartphones handle artificial intelligence tasks, along with changes to how it delivers those blueprints that could help speed their adoption. Arm's technology powered the rise of smartphones and is increasingly found in PCs and in data centers, where chip designers have gravitated toward its energy efficiency. Smartphones remain Arm's biggest single market, where the company supplies intellectual property to arch rivals such as Apple (AAPL.O)   and Android chip suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM.O)   and MediaTek (2454.TW)  . On Wednesday, Arm launched new designs for central processing units (CPUs) that it said are better suited to AI work and new graphics processing units (GPUs). It will also provide software tools to make it easier for developers to run chatbots and other AI code on Arm chips. But the bigger change is in how those products are sold. In the past, Arm mostly delivered its technology as either specifications or abstract designs that chip companies then needed to turn into a physical blueprint for a chip - which in turn is no small task when deciding how arrange billions of transistors, the tiny switches that make up chips. For the new products, Arm worked with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS)   and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)   to deliver blueprints of physical designs that are ready for manufacturing. Chris Bergey, senior vice president and general manager of Arm's client line of business, said Arm is not trying to compete with its customers. It is instead trying to help them get to market faster while focusing on other increasingly important parts of both PC and phone chips, such as a neural processing units (NPU) that provide the best AI performance. That part of a chip has become so important that Microsoft said its most recent AI features won't work without it. Arm currently does not supply NPU technology for phones and PCs, and Bergey the company aims to provide more \"done and baked\" designs that chip firms can attach their NPUs to. \"We're combining a platform where these accelerators can be very tightly coupled,\" Bergey said."

        "content": "SEOUL, May 29 (Reuters) - A Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   union in South Korea will begin escalating strike action next week by staging the first ever walkout over demands for higher wages, union officials said on Wednesday. The National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), which has about 28,000 members, or more than a fifth of the company's total workforce, said it will stop work for one day on June 7 as part of broader protest measures. The announcement was made by union officials at a live-streamed press conference, where they held a banner which read: \"We can no longer tolerate labour repression, union repression.\" If the union members collectively take the day off next week, it would mark the first ever walkout by South Korean workers at the world's top memory chipmaker. Workers have been intermittently participating in protests in recent weeks outside the company's offices in the capital city Seoul as well as outside its chip production site in Hwaseong, south of Seoul. Responding to a decision by the company to increase wages this year by 5.1%, the union has previously said that it wanted an additional day of annual leave as well as transparent performance-based bonuses. On Wednesday, the union accused the tech giant of failing to bring a compromise plan to negotiations held the previous day. Samsung Electronics said in a statement on Wednesday: \"We will sincerely engage in discussions with the union.\" Union officials defended the decision to take industrial action at a time when some parts of Samsung's business are underperforming. \"The company has been saying they are facing crisis all along for the past 10 year,\" Son Woo-mok, president of NSEU told reporters, but added that the firm should not use it as an excuse not to meet its demands. The union said all company sites across South Korea would be affected by its June 7 action. NSEU is the biggest of five labour unions at South Korea's tech giant. It is not clear whether other smaller unions plan to join the action. Responding to Wednesday's proposed strike, a coalition of five unions at Samsung affiliates including another Samsung Electronics union questioned the intention behind the strike plan, indicating they would not join the move. The coalition said in a statement it appears to be part of efforts to join a combative umbrella union, rather than to improve workers' conditions at the tech company. The strike announcement comes as Samsung, one of the world's biggest chipmakers and smartphone makers, appears to be faltering in some areas, including cutting-edge semiconductor chips. Samsung last week replaced the head of its semiconductor unit saying a new person at the top was needed to navigate what it called a \"crisis\" affecting the chips industry. More than 2,000 unionised workers of the South Korean technology giant gathered in Seoul last week to hold a rare rally to demand better wages. Union membership has increased rapidly after Samsung Electronics in 2020 pledged to put an end to its practices of discouraging the growth of organised labour. Analysts said the rise in union membership reflects workers' frustration with a recent slump in Samsung's competitiveness in businesses such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and due to legal issues facing the tech giant. In one case the company is battling a prosecution appeal of a decision that found Samsung Electronics' chairman Jay Y. Lee not guilty of fraud and other charges related to a 2015 merger of Samsung companies. Shares of Samsung Electronics closed down 3.1% on Wednesday, compared with the benchmark KOSPI's 1.7% fall."

The Seoul summit, attended by UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, follows Yoon's state visit last year to Abu Dhabi and focused on energy and defence, as South Korea seeks to tap the investment potential of the energy-rich Gulf state. Yoon's office said the UAE reaffirmed last year's pledge of $30 billion in investment for South Korean businesses, in areas from nuclear power and defence to hydrogen and solar energy. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company signed a letter of intent for Hanwha Ocean and Samsung Heavy Industries to build at least six LNG carriers valued at about $1.5 billion, it said. Industry ministers formally signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement agreed in October that will remove all tariffs on South Korean arms exports when it is ratified, South Korea said. South Korea has signed a series of global defence equipment contracts as part of its plans to become the world's fourth-largest defence exporter by 2027. The UAE will also drop import duty on automobiles over the next decade, while South Korea's tariffs on crude oil imports will be removed. The deal will eventually scrap tariffs on more than 90% of the imports of both nations. \"South Korea's crude oil imports from the UAE are expected to increase,\" Seoul's Minister of Trade Cheong In-kyo told a press conference, underlining the country's dependence on energy imports. The UAE is expected to sign a CEPA with Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines in the next few months, Minister of Foreign Trade Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi said. On Tuesday, Sheikh Mohammed met the leaders of some of South Korea's top conglomerates including Jay Y. Lee of Samsung Electronics, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and Kim Dong-kwan of Hanwha Group, which has emerged as a major defence contractor. No new arms deal was unveiled, but Yoon's office said both aim to boost cooperation of their defence industries."

The two will discuss deepening their \"special strategic partnership,\" Yoon's office said in a statement. Four F-15K Air Force fighter jets escorted Sheikh Mohamed's plane as it entered the South Korean defence identification zone and landed at a military airfield just south of the capital, Seoul, Yoon's office said. Sheikh Mohammed is reciprocating after Yoon's state visit to Abu Dhabi early last year, when the UAE pledged $30 billion in investment in South Korean businesses in areas spanning nuclear power, defence, hydrogen and solar energy. He met on Tuesday the leaders of some of South Korea's top business conglomerates including Jay Y. Lee of Samsung Electronics, SK Group's Chey Tae-won and Euisun Chung of Hyundai Motor Group. South Korea already has deep business ties with the UAE going back more than a decade, having previously won contracts to build nuclear reactors in the Gulf state. The country has also signed massive defence contracts as part of plans to become the world's fourth-largest defence exporter by 2027. Recent deals include one with Poland, which is seeking to bolster its defences as a close neighbour of Ukraine, which is at war with Russia. Earlier this year, South Korea also reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia to expand defence cooperation with a view to increase arms sales in the region. South Korea's weapons exports to the Middle East grew nearly tenfold between 2013 and 2022, according to the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Market analysts cited the UAE state visit for driving up South Korean defence stocks on Tuesday, with Hanwha Aerospace (012450.KS)   and LIG Nex1 (079550.KS)   rising more than 5% and Korea Aerospace Industries (047810.KS)   climbing 7.1%.

Prosecutors are appealing against a February ruling that found Lee not guilty of all charges including accounting fraud and stock manipulation. Prosecutors had sought a five-year jail term. Lee denied wrongdoing, arguing that he and other executives acted on the belief the merger would benefit shareholders. Lee was not required to attend Monday's preparatory hearing at the Seoul High Court. Preparatory hearings are conducted to set up future schedules. Shim Gi-ho, one of the prosecutors, said the prosecution found the lower court's decision \"difficult to accept\" and proposed bringing 11 witnesses to the stand in the appeal. Lawyers for Lee and other defendants opposed the proposal, saying the witnesses were neither independent from the case nor likely to reveal new facts. Baik Kang-jin, the presiding judge, said the prosecution would have to present sufficient reasons for him to accept the request to call new witnesses. The judge scheduled the next preparatory hearing for July 22. Samsung Electronics declined to comment on the appeal. Lee, 55, and other former executives had been accused of engineering a merger between two Samsung affiliates - Samsung C&T (028260.KS)   and Cheil Industries - in a way that dealt poorly with interests of minority shareholders. The Seoul Central District Court acquitted Lee and 13 other defendants of all charges, saying that the merger decision was reached by the boards of the two companies after consideration. Lee met Chinese Premier Li Qiang and other senior Chinese government officials on Sunday on the sidelines of a trilateral summit between South Korea, China and Japan in Seoul. At the meeting, Li told Lee that China welcomed further investment by Samsung, Chinese state media reported."

        "content": "SEOUL/TOKYO/BEIJING, May 26 (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Li Qiang agreed with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday to launch a diplomatic and security dialogue and resume free trade talks, and discussed tensions around Taiwan with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The leaders held bilateral meetings in Seoul a day before the first summit by the three Asian neighbours in more than four years. China and the U.S.-allied South Korea and Japan are trying to manage rising distrust amid the rivalry between Beijing and Washington and tensions over Taiwan. Expectations are low for Monday's trilateral summit, but even handshakes would help maintain at least some high-level diplomacy after years of deteriorating relations, diplomats and officials say. Yoon told Li that South Korea and China should work together not only to promote shared interests based on mutual respect but also on regional and global issues to tackle common challenges, citing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict and global economic uncertainties. \"I hope to continue to strengthen bilateral cooperation even in the face of today's global complex crises,\" Yoon said at the start of the meeting, according to his office. Yoon asked China to play a greater role as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, especially as North Korea continues to develop nuclear missiles and boost military cooperation with Russia, saying another spy satellite launch using intercontinental ballistic-missile technology is imminent. Li told Yoon their countries should oppose turning economic and trade issues into political or security ones, and should work to maintain stable supply chains, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. Li said China was ready to strengthen cooperation in high-end manufacturing, new energy, artificial intelligence, biomedicine and other fields. China will further expand market access, strengthen guarantees for foreign investment and welcomes more South Korean companies do business in the country, he said. In a separate meeting with Samsung Chairman Jay Y. Lee, Li encouraged the Korean tech giant to boost its investment in China. In recent years, Chinese leaders and diplomats have frequently condemned the U.S. and its allies over export controls targeting its semiconductor industry by calling on these countries to stop \"overstretching the concept of national security\". Since 2021, Chinese companies and state entities have been increasingly cut off from ready access to the world's most advanced chips, many of them produced by South Korean tech giants, such as Samsung and SK Hynix. Li expressed hopes for continuing efforts to \"build consensus and resolve differences\" through \"equal dialogue and sincere communications.\" The three leaders attended a banquet where multicultural choirs and bands performed traditional and modern songs, while the menu included tofu, dumplings and bean pastes - cuisine staples in all three countries. At a separate meeting with Kishida, Yoon lauded progress on diplomatic, economic and cultural exchanges with Japan, and they agreed to deepen ties next year when the two countries celebrate the 60th anniversary of normalising relations, Yoon's office said. Kishida also met separately with Li, stressing the importance of the stability of the Taiwan Strait for Japan and the international community. Li told Kishida that he hoped Japan would \"properly handle issues like Taiwan\", Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported. Kishida told reporters after the meeting he had asked Beijing to lift an import ban on Japanese seafood, imposed after Japan began releasing treated wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific. He also asked for the early release of Japanese citizens detained in China. China and Japan agreed to hold a new round of bilateral high-level economic dialogue at an appropriate time, according to CCTV. The three neighbours had agreed to hold annual summits starting in 2008, but bilateral feuds and the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the initiative, with the last three-way summit held in late 2019. Yoon, Li and Kishida will adopt a joint statement on six areas including the economy and trade, science and technology, people-to-people exchanges and health and the aging population, Seoul officials said. The summit comes as South Korea and Japan have been working to mend ties frayed by historical disputes while deepening a trilateral security partnership with the United States amid its intensifying rivalry with China. Beijing has previously warned that U.S. efforts to further elevate relations with South Korea and Japan could fan regional tension and confrontation. Seoul and Tokyo have warned against any attempts to forcibly change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, while Beijing on Tuesday criticised a decision by South Korean and Japanese lawmakers to attend Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's inauguration."

Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   has over the past six years invested $24 billion in the Chinese market, a company executive was quoted as saying in a November report by state-run China Daily. But the Korean tech giant has seen its business face growing challenges amid U.S.-China tensions as it navigates export controls Washington has rolled out to cut off China's access to cutting-edge chips. Li's choice to meet with a Samsung executive echoed earlier remarks the Chinese leader gave during a bilateral meeting with Yoon, where he encouraged more Korean enterprises to invest and do business in China and urged Beijing and Seoul to cooperate on maintaining the stability of industrial supply chains."

        "content": "SEOUL, May 24 (Reuters) - Against a backdrop of K-pop performances and dance music, more than 2,000 unionised workers from Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   gathered in Seoul on Friday, holding a rare rally to demand the South Korean technology giant pay fair wages. Over the last two years, the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) has seen its membership swell four-fold to about 28,000, or more than a fifth of the company's total workforce, union officials said. The rapid growth of the union's membership comes after the country's most powerful conglomerate pledged in 2020 to put an end to its practices of discouraging the growth of organised labour. Jay Y. Lee, chairman of Samsung Electronics, had at the time publicly apologised for scandals over union-busting tactics and declared an end to a \"no-union\" philosophy. Government data shows employee union membership levels have not risen in South Korea for the past two decades and remain relatively low compared to some other OECD countries. But more young workers are becoming convinced about the benefits of unionisation, union officials have said. Chanting \"respect labour\", the unionised engineers and office workers were also entertained by electronic dance music played by a well-known comedian-turned-DJ, who dresses as a Buddhist monk. K-pop singers also performed, prompting unionised workers in their 20s and 30s to clap and dance, with the rally near Samsung's office in the glitzy Gangnam district of Seoul at times resembling a street party. \"Our rallies are non-violent but we can still show our strength,\" said Choi Young-wook, a 27-year-old Samsung chip engineer, who wore a black cap with the union's logo. The rally comes as Samsung's run of success appears to be faltering in some areas, including cutting-edge semiconductor chips. Samsung this week replaced the head of its semiconductor unit saying a new person at the top was needed to navigate what it called a \"crisis\" affecting the chips industry. The company has decided to increase wages this year by 5.1% and while the union does not necessarily oppose such a hike it wants one more day in annual leaves as well as transparent performance-based bonuses, the union has said. Negotiations between the company and the union resumed on May 21, according to the union, though some officials questioned the company's commitment to consulting with them. In a statement to Reuters, Samsung Electronics said that working-level negotiations had resumed, and the main negotiations were scheduled to take place on May 28. \"We will sincerely engage in discussions with the union,\" said the statement. Union officials say that among younger employees there is a growing perception that unions can help create a fairer workplace, whereas the older generation in the company felt unions could disrupt work productivity. Overall, South Korea's union membership rate has hovered around the 10% level since 2004, according to data from the labour ministry. \"More and more people inside the company are realising why they need unions, which is to have a voice, and we are getting empowered by these people day by day,\" said Son Woo-mok, president of NSEU, who began working at Samsung in 2005."

        "content": "HONG KONG, May 24 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks were in focus at a hedge fund conference this week, accounting for most of the top Asia investment ideas as asset managers highlighted Japan Inc's efforts to improve capital efficiency as well as the record run for Tokyo shares. At the annual Sohn Hong Kong Investment Leaders Conference which invites 14 funds to pitch their top investment ideas, Japanese companies in outsourcing, robotics and the drug sector were in favour. Only two funds pitched ideas on Chinese stocks, down from seven in 2023. The biggest opportunities in the world's third-largest economy are in companies with \"improving stories\" or are bolstering corporate governance, rather than firms that are already excellent, according to David Mitchinson, founding partner at London-based Zennor Asset Management. Mitchinson recommends Transcosmos (9715.T)   which provides outsourcing services and is likely to benefit from Japan's tight labour market. The firm's growth has slowed but it has shown willingness to improve capital management such as its plan to cancel treasury shares, he added. While Japan has been bolstering governance for at least a decade, the effort got a big shot in the arm last year when the Tokyo Stock Exchange called on companies to improve capital efficiency. The bourse now publishes a monthly list of firms that have voluntarily disclosed plans to improve their use of capital. Also helped by a weak yen, the benchmark Nikkei has surged 50% since the beginning of 2023, hitting a record high in February this year. Japan's government continues to raise the bar for management, so \"investors who engage with Japanese companies have a lot higher chance of winning than ever before,\" Seth Fischer, founder of activist fund Oasis Management, said in an interview ahead of the conference. The fund sees upside potential for Kobayashi Pharmaceutical (4967.T)  , a drugmaker which recently recalled a health supplement after five deaths possibly linked to the product. Fischer told the conference the stock could climb if there was improved crisis management or if it went private. Oasis could step in if there was no \"self-improvement\", he said, without disclosing if Oasis has shares in Kobayashi. Hong Kong's Tybourne Capital Management said it is betting that Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   can grab global memory chip market share from rival SK Hynix (000660.KS)  , which has much production capacity in China that it might not be able to make full use of amid geopolitical tensions. CloudAlpha Capital Management, also from Hong Kong, is bullish on South Korea's HD Hyundai Electric (267260.KS)  , citing AI-linked demand for electricity equipment."

        "content": "SEOUL/SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics' (005930.KS)   latest high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips have yet to pass Nvidia's (NVDA.O)   tests for use in the U.S. firm's AI processors due to heat and power consumption problems, three people briefed on the issues said. The problems affect Samsung's HBM3 chips, which are the fourth-generation HBM standard currently most used in graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence, as well as fifth-generation HBM3E chips that the South Korean tech giant and its rivals are bringing to market this year, they said. The reasons for Samsung failing Nvidia's tests are being reported for the first time. Samsung said in a statement to Reuters that HBM is a customized memory product requiring \"optimization processes in tandem with customers' needs,\" adding that it is in the process of optimizing its products through close collaboration with customers. It declined to comment on specific customers. In separate statements after Reuters first published this report, Samsung said that \"claims of failing due to heat and power consumption are not true,\" and that testing was \"proceeding smoothly and as planned.\" Nvidia declined to comment. HBM - a type of dynamic random access memory or DRAM standard first produced in 2013 in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption - helps process massive amounts of data produced by complex AI applications. As demand for sophisticated GPUs has soared amid the generative AI boom, so has demand for HBM. Satisfying Nvidia - which commands around 80% of the global GPU market for AI applications - is seen as key to future growth for HBM manufacturers - both reputationally and in terms of profit momentum. Samsung has been trying to pass Nvidia's tests for HBM3 and HBM3E since last year, the three sources said. According to two of the people, the results of a recent failed test for Samsung's 8-layer and 12-layer HBM3E chips came in April. It was not immediately clear if the problems can be easily addressed, but the three sources said that the failures to meet Nvidia's requirements have increased concerns in the industry and among investors that Samsung could fall further behind rivals SK Hynix (000660.KS)   and Micron Technology (MU.O)   in HBM. The sources, two of whom were briefed on the matter by Samsung officials, spoke on condition of anonymity as the information was confidential. Samsung's shares fell 2% in early Friday trade, slightly weaker than the broader market. In contrast to Samsung, domestic rival SK Hynix is the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia and has been supplying HBM3 since June 2022. It also began supplying HBM3E in late March to a customer it declined to identify. Shipments went to Nvidia, sources have said. Micron, the only other major manufacturer of HBM, has also said it will supply Nvidia with HBM3E. In a move that analysts said appeared to underscore Samsung's concerns about its laggard position in HBM, Samsung this week replaced the head of its semiconductor unit saying a new person at the top was needed to navigate what it called a \"crisis\" affecting the industry. Market expectations have been high that Samsung, as the world's biggest maker of memory chips, would quickly pass Nvidia's tests, but it's also natural that specialised products like HBM will take some time to meet customers' performance evaluations, said Jeff Kim, head of research at KB Securities. Although Samsung has yet to become a supplier of HBM3 to Nvidia, it does supply customers such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O)   (AMD) and is aiming to begin mass production of HBM3E chips in the second quarter. Samsung said in its statement to Reuters that its product schedule is proceeding as planned. Analysts also say that SK Hynix, which developed the first HBM chip in 2013, has spent far more time and resources on HBM research and development than Samsung over the past decade, accounting for its technological edge. Samsung said in its statement that it developed the first commercial HBM solution for high-performance computing in 2015 and has continued to invest in HBM since then. GPU manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD are keen for Samsung to perfect its HBM chips so they can have more vendor options and weaken SK Hynix's pricing power, the sources also said. At an Nvidia AI conference in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signed a placard at Samsung's booth that said \"Jensen approved\" for Samsung's 12-layer HBM3E - underscoring the company's enthusiasm about the prospect of Samsung supplying those chips. HBM3E chips are likely to become the mainstream HBM product in the market this year with shipments concentrated in the second half of 2024, according to research firm Trendforce. Separately, SK Hynix estimates that demand for HBM memory chips in general could increase at an annual rate of 82% through 2027. Analysts have said that Samsung's relatively weak position in HBM has been noticed by investors. Its shares are down 2% for the year to date, while SK Hynix's stock is up 42% and Micron's shares are up 48%. ($1 = 1,362.8600 won)"

Jurors in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas agreed with Netlist   that Micron's semiconductor-memory products infringe two Netlist patents related to technology for improving the capacity and performance of memory modules. The jury also concluded that Micron infringed the patents willfully, which could lead to a judge multiplying the damages by up to three times. Representatives for Micron did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. \"We are grateful for the jury's service, and their recognition of the importance of Netlist's innovation,\" Netlist attorney Jason Sheasby said in a statement. Netlist won a $303 million verdict against Samsung in the same court last year in a related dispute over high-performance computer memory patents. Boise, Idaho-based Micron's stock price has surged this year based on demand for its chips used to power artificial-intelligence technology. Irvine, California-based Netlist sued Micron in 2022, alleging that three of its semiconductor memory-module lines infringed its patents. Micron denied the allegations and raised several defenses, including arguments that the patents were invalid. A U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal invalidated one of the patents in April, which could eventually reduce the size of the verdict."

Under the package, President Yoon Suk Yeol said a financial support programme worth about 17 trillion won was planned through state-run Korea Development Bank to back investments by semiconductor companies, according to the presidential office. \"As we all know, semiconductors are a field where all-out national warfare is underway. Win or lose, that depends on who can make cutting-edge semiconductors first,\" Yoon said at a meeting with top government officials. South Korea, home to the world's top memory chip makers Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and SK Hynix (000660.KS), has fallen behind some rivals in areas such as chip design and contract chip manufacturing. South Korea's share of the global fabless sector, which is dominated by companies like U.S. giant Nvidia (NVDA.O) that design chips but outsource manufacturing, stood at about 1%, Yoon's office said. There was also a gap between local chipmakers and the leading contract chip makers like Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW), it said. Yoon said a 1 trillion won fund would be set up to support equipment makers and fabless companies. Industry minister Ahn Duk-geun said the government aimed to help boost South Korea's global market share in non-memory chips, such as mobile processors, to 10% from the current 2%. The package is bigger than plans flagged by the country's finance minister Choi Sang-mok earlier this month, when he said the government was targeting support for chip investments and research worth more than 10 trillion won. In a press briefing, Choi described South Korea's chip support package \"as good as\" any other country. Countries around the world ranging from China to the United States have been ploughing tens of billions of dollars via grants and other means to support their own chip sectors. \"The government is apparently trying to follow the trend where other countries are giving out subsidies for their own chip companies,\" said Greg Roh, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities. South Korea is building a mega chip cluster in Yongin, south of the capital Seoul, touted as the world's largest high-tech chipmaking complex to attract chip equipment and fabless companies. Finance minister Choi said the government would streamline bureaucracy and cut red tape to help speed up construction of the chip cluster at twice the normal rate. In January, Yoon, who has vowed to pour all possible resources into the country's chip industry, said he would extend tax credits on investments in the domestic semiconductor industry to boost employment and attract more talent."

        "content": "HONG KONG, April 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) investors are used to the chip market's notoriously brutal boom-and-bust cycles. Artificial intelligence, though, might help ease future swings. On Friday, the $420 billion tech conglomerate estimated first-quarter operating profit to be 6.6 trillion won ($4.9 billion), a 10-fold surge from the same period a year ago. It's a welcome sign that the market for memory semiconductors used for data storage has finally bottomed out. Consumer demand for electronics is recovering globally, while inventory levels have probably peaked; tech companies are starting to restock chip supplies again. After falling for much of the past two years, the average selling price for DRAM chips in the three months to March rose by more than a fifth from the previous quarter, according to Bernstein analysts. Samsung, which generates the bulk of its operating profit from semiconductors, is forecast to more than double earnings this year, per analysts' estimates gathered by LSEG. This upturn could be different. Semiconductors accounted for roughly a quarter of Samsung's top line last year. Mainstream memory ones are commoditised products, and vulnerable to cycles of excess inventory. Industry consolidation has helped, with Samsung, compatriot SK Hynix (000660.KS) and U.S.-based Micron Technology (MU.O) dominating the market today, but they were still caught out in the past two years. That might gradually change: AI customers like Nvidia (NVDA.O) are asking for more specialised and customised storage chips including high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, and low latency DRAM. Demand for the former is expected to surge 60% annually in the mid-to-long term, SK Hynix reckons. HBM revenue at Samsung could top $13 billion in 2025, or 13% of its total semiconductor sales, per JPMorgan analysts. Over the longer term, that could help cushion volatility. The company also looks well-positioned to grab share in the market for making logic chips used to process data. Shares of Samsung are up 28% over the past six months and now trade on over 16 times forecast next 12-month earnings, LSEG data show, above its five-year average of 13 times. The AI boom can help rewrite Samsung's fortunes. Follow @mak_robyn on X (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. All views expressed are their own.)

        "content": "SEOUL, April 5 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) estimated on Friday its first-quarter operating profit would rise more than 10-fold, topping market expectations, as chip prices have started to rebound from a severe downturn thanks to a boom in artificial intelligence. But the guidance was not enough to cheer investors who sent Samsung shares down 1.3% early on Friday, in line with a 1.1% drop in the wider South Korean market (.KS11), as they await updates on progress in its high-end memory chip business that has been lagging behind rivals. The world's largest memory chip and TV maker estimated its operating profit rose to a better-than-expected 6.6 trillion won ($4.89 billion) in the quarter ended March 31, beating a 5.7 trillion won LSEG SmartEstimate. That was up 931% from 640 billion won a year earlier and would be Samsung's highest operating profit since the third quarter of 2022. But revenue missed expectations, likely rising 11% from the same period a year earlier to 71 trillion won, below a LSEG SmartEstimate of 72.3 trillion won. \"Since revenue was mostly in line but operating profit beat expectations, the inventory valuation of NAND flash chips may have improved. Demand for NAND has improved, which may have improved margins as well,\" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Korea Investor Relations Service. \"Initial response to new Galaxy S24 smartphones was also positive due to on-device AI, so if greater-than-expected portion of the high-margin premium smartphones were sold, it would have an impact.\" The company is due to release detailed earnings on April 30. The better performance came as its chip division, traditionally its biggest earner, is expected to report its first quarterly profit in five quarters as memory chip prices bounce back from a deep trough that began in mid-2022 due to weak post-pandemic demand for gadgets. DRAM chip prices rose about 20% during the first quarter versus the previous quarter, while NAND flash chip prices increased by 23% to 28%, according to data provider TrendForce. The bullish outlook for memory chip demand, including exploding appetite for chips such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets, has driven a 34% rise in Samsung shares over the last 12 months, beating a 10% gain in the broader market. But it has underperformed its cross-town rival SK Hynix (000660.KS), whose shares surged 122% during the same period, in the booming HBM market, partly due to its relatively late entry into the segment. Analysts expect Samsung to catch up gradually, as it plans to begin shipments of its latest and most powerful HBM chips in the third quarter. \"Samsung is working hard on HBM, but nothing is visible yet...Compared to competitors, Samsung stock has underperformed due to HBM,\" said Kim Roko, an analyst at Hana Securities. \"It may be difficult to increase market share with the 8-layer HBM3E currently being released, but no company has yet received approval for the 12-layer version expected near year-end. I think Samsung may pass on what it has not been able to do and win with more advanced products.\" The 7.2-magnitude earthquake that struck Taiwan on Wednesday is likely to tighten semiconductor supply, and analysts said Samsung and SK Hynix may hike memory chip prices by a sharper margin than previously planned, potentially boosting second-quarter earnings. In its mobile business, Samsung likely reported a solid profit after launching sales of its new flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones in late January, analysts said. Eugene Investment & Securities estimates Samsung shipped 57 million smartphones during the quarter, up 8% from the fourth quarter, and the average selling price of Samsung smartphones likely rose 30% to $340 quarter-on-quarter, supporting profits. Global sales of Galaxy S24 smartphones grew by 8% compared to the previous year's Galaxy S23 series during their first three weeks of availability, data provider Counterpoint said.

Operating profit for the world's biggest maker of memory chips and TVs likely rose to 5.7 trillion won ($4.24 billion) in the quarter ended March 31, according to the average of an LSEG SmartEstimate from 27 analysts, weighted toward those who are more consistently accurate. If so, it would be Samsung's highest profit since the third quarter of 2022. It compares with an operating profit of 640 billion won in the first quarter last year. This is because its chip division, traditionally its biggest earner, is expected to report its first quarterly profit in five quarters of about 750 billion won, according to an average estimate from 12 analysts. Memory chip prices have rebounded from a deep trough that began mid-2022 due to weak post-pandemic demand for gadgets that use the chips. During the first quarter, memory chip prices jumped by about 20% versus the previous quarter for DRAM chips used in tech devices and 23% to 28% for NAND Flash chips used for data storage, according to data provider TrendForce. The bullish outlook for memory chip demand, including exploding appetite for chips such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in artificial intelligence chipsets, has driven a 29% rise in Samsung shares over the last 12 months. Samsung's chip design and chip contract manufacturing businesses are still loss-making, analysts said. But memory chipmakers have limited supply of lower-margin chips since the downturn, while buyers are restocking inventory, improving the tech giant's profits. Meanwhile, its mobile business likely reported an operating profit of around 3.8 trillion won, according to an average of forecasts from 12 analysts, slightly below the unit's 3.94 trillion won profit a year ago. Samsung began selling its latest flagship Galaxy S24 smartphones at the end of January, with a bevy of AI functions to compete with rival Apple (AAPL.O) at the top end of the market. This led Samsung to ship an estimated 57 million smartphones during the first quarter, up 8% from the previous quarter according to Eugene Investment & Securities. The average selling price of Samsung smartphones also likely rose 30% to $340 quarter-on-quarter, supporting profits, Eugene said.

The 1.97-trillion-rupee ($24 billion) production-linked incentive scheme (PLI) is India's key industrial policy and covers 14 sectors ranging from electronic products to drones. Critical to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plans to promote India as a global manufacturing hub, the scheme has drawn participation from large global and Indian firms including Apple (AAPL.O)  , Foxconn (2354.TW)  , Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HLL.NS)   and Reliance Industries (RELI.NS)  . It has also helped push mobile phone exports to a record $15 billion in the fiscal year that ended March 31, according to industry estimates. \"The scheme has had a good impact and incentive disbursements have also picked up,\" Rajesh Kumar Singh, top bureaucrat at India's Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, told Reuters. India has exported goods worth 3 trillion rupees - 3.5 trillion rupees under the PLI scheme, the official said. Production in sectors such as mobile phones, electronics and food processing has \"moved faster\", while that in white goods and drones has also picked up, he said. Still, textile and specialty steel sectors are seeing some lag and the incentives for those may require tweaks, Singh, whose department oversees the scheme's implementation, said. India regularly reviews the scheme's uptake. There are no \"immediate plans\" to expand the incentives to other sectors, the official said. ($1 = 83.4350 Indian rupees)"

        "content": "April 2 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O)   on Tuesday disclosed deepening operating losses for its foundry business, a blow to the chipmaker as it tries to regain a technology lead it lost in recent years to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2330.TW)  . Intel said the manufacturing unit had $7 billion in operating losses for 2023, a steeper loss than the $5.2 billion in operating losses the year before. The unit had revenue of $18.9 billion for 2023, down 31% from $27.49 billion the year before. Intel shares were down 4.3% after the documents were filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During a presentation for investors, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said 2024 would be the year of worst operating losses for the company's chipmaking business and that it expects to break even on an operating basis by about 2027. Gelsinger said the foundry business was weighed down by bad decisions, including one year ago against using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines from Dutch firm ASML (ASML.AS)  . While those machines can cost more than $150 million, they are more cost-effective than earlier chip making tools. Partially as a result of the missteps, Intel has outsourced about 30% of the total number of wafers to external contract manufacturers such as TSMC, Gelsinger said. It aims to bring that number down to roughly 20%. Intel has now switched over to using EUV tools, which will cover more and more production needs as older machines are phased out. \"In the post EUV era, we see that we're very competitive now on price, performance (and) back to leadership,\" Gelsinger said. \"And in the pre-EUV era we carried a lot of costs and (were) uncompetitive.\" Intel plans to spend $100 billion on building or expanding chip factories in four U.S. states. Its business turnaround plan depends on persuading outside companies to use its manufacturing services. As part of that plan, Intel told investors it would start reporting the results of its manufacturing operations as a standalone unit. The company has been investing heavily to catch up to its primary chipmaking rivals, TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS)  .

        "content": "HONG KONG, April 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nvidia (NVDA.O)   has ridden the wave of excitement about artificial intelligence to become the world\u2019s third most valuable company. Yet founder Jensen Huang says the $2.3 trillion chip designer would not exist without Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (2330.TW)  . His statement underscores how indispensable the $625 billion Taiwanese group is for the global technology industry. TSMC has achieved its heft while keeping most of its factories and employees in Taiwan. Now U.S.-China tensions and the artificial intelligence boom are spurring it to venture overseas. How it navigates global expansion will influence the fate of entire industries and economies. Take apart any smartphone, computer, or other advanced electronic device, and there's good chance that the chip inside was made by TSMC. The company has a 60%-plus share of the global market for contract chipmaking and a monopoly over advanced microprocessors. TSMC\u2019s dominance owes much to its now-retired founder, Morris Chang, who pioneered a model which separated producing chips from designing them. Rather than spending billions of dollars to build their own factories \u2013 known as fabs \u2013 tech giants like Apple (AAPL.O)   outsource manufacturing of microprocessors to TSMC, which can make them at a lower cost. Offshoring production to Asia has enabled the creation of a hyper-efficient industry that churns out over a trillion units a year, while making the Taiwanese company a lynchpin in the complex global semiconductor supply chain. TSMC's tightly controlled factories are among the most profitable in the world, generating an annual gross profit margin of over 50% in each of the past three years. Financial success has allowed the company to pull ahead of rivals like Intel (INTC.O)   by pouring cash into developing new techniques. TSMC\u2019s capital spending has averaged $30 billion a year since 2021, second only to chips-to-smartphone maker Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  . Two trends now threaten this status quo. China considers democratically governed Taiwan its own territory. A Chinese invasion would upend the Taiwanese economy and trigger a wave of sanctions from the U.S. and its allies. That could knock a tenth off global GDP as multinational firms and governments lost access to TSMC's chips, Bloomberg Economics estimated  . Meanwhile, breakthroughs in generative artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and other innovations require ever more processing power. The challenge of squeezing more transistors onto a single sliver of silicon is forcing manufacturers to pioneer new methods and materials. That is pushing up costs. The next-generation lithography machine from ASML (ASML.AS)  , the Dutch firm whose devices print miniscule circuit boards on silicon, costs over $300 million, more than double its current model. An advanced fab completed in 2026 will cost between $35 billion and $43 billion to run for a decade, according   to Boston Consulting Group. That\u2019s two-thirds more than today. To hedge against geopolitical risks and stay abreast of new innovations, many governments are eager to bring chip manufacturing onshore. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act offers $53 billion in grants plus another $24 billion of tax credits. The European Union followed up last year with a $47 billion plan. This explains why TSMC is transforming itself into a global manufacturer. Yet it has some catching up to do. Unlike other Asian companies such as Samsung or Japan's Toyota Motor (7203.T)  , which began making cars in the U.S. in the 1980s, Taiwan's corporate champions have thrived by largely staying close to home. TSMC also has painful memories of venturing overseas. Its factory in Washington state, set up over two decades ago, is a reminder of the steep learning curve. TSMC struggled with higher-than-expected costs, a chip market downturn and labour issues. \"Initially it was chaos, it was just a series of ugly surprises\", Chang recounted   of the project that was meant to transform Portland's economy. After a few years of \"trying to make it work\", the company decided not to expand. Chang described making chips in the U.S. \"a very expensive exercise in futility\". Chang\u2019s successors, led by CEO Dr. C.C. Wei, may have better luck this time. TSMC is investing a total of $40 billion in two large, advanced semiconductor plants in Arizona. It has also teamed up with customers like Sony (6758.T)   and Toyota to build new fabs in Japan and may have similar plans in Germany. The U.S. projects have suffered delays, cost overruns, shortages of skilled workers, and clashes with local labour unions. And the government in Washington has yet to commit funds to TSMC. Still, the company is set to secure more than $5 billion in federal grants, Bloomberg reported   in early March, citing people familiar with the matter. Additional tax credits should help make up for higher costs. Moreover, TSMC\u2019s dominance enables it to pass on higher expenses to customers like Apple keen to diversify supply chains from Asia. Red-hot demand for server chips used to power artificial intelligence models offers a further boost. As a result, the company reckons it can stick to its long-term target for a gross profit margin of above 53% and a return on equity of 25% or more. Yet as TSMC diverts resources to replicating its Taiwanese operations around the world, spending on technological advances may slow. The more immediate risk is a supply glut. Large chipmakers are racing to add new capacity on expectations that AI will drive demand for years. Though the new technology accounted for just 6% of TSMC\u2019s top line in 2023, the company expects that to reach the high teens by 2027. Yet that is far from certain, as the business case for self-teaching models remains fuzzy. TSMC\u2019s dominance may also face challenges. Upstarts like the Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI, which operates the ChatGPT chatbot, are unhappy with the status quo. Its Chief Executive Sam Altman has complained about the cost of Nvidia's hugely sought-after chips and is in talks to raise trillions of dollars to boost the world's chip-building capacity, according to the Wall Street Journal. Investors have their doubts. The AI craze has pushed up TSMC shares by nearly 50% over the past six months, but this largely reflects rising earnings expectations. The stock trades on 19 times forecast earnings for the next 12 months, according to LSEG data. That\u2019s on a par with the five-year average but below Intel, which trades on a multiple of 28 times. Re-engineering itself may be TSMC\u2019s most complex task. Follow @mak_robyn on X  (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.  The opinions expressed are her own.)"

Exports rose 3.1% from the same period a year prior to $56.56 billion, missing a gain of 5.2% tipped in a Reuters poll of economists. That followed a 4.8% increase a month earlier, hinting at recovery in global economic momentum as South Korea's dominance in semiconductors and other high-tech goods makes the country a barometer for global demand. Imports declined 12.3% in March from the same month a year earlier to $52.28 billion, deeper than a 8.1% fall seen in the poll but easing slightly from a 13.1% drop in February. Overseas sales of chips grew for a fifth successive month, rising 35.7% and logging the best performance by value in two years, trade ministry data showed. Increasing demand for artificial intelligence-related memory is driving semiconductor sales, as the world's two biggest makers of memory chips - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   and SK Hynix (000660.KS)   - flagged improving chip demand for the year ahead. Exports of computers and mobile communication devices increased 24.5% and 5.5% respectively, while that for cars declined 5%. By destination, exports to China rose 0.4% from a year earlier and those to the United States increased 11.6%. Separate data released on Monday however showed weaker manufacturing activity in March as slowing domestic demand offset robust overseas sales. The purchasing managers index stood at 49.8 in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 50.7 in February, the data showed. Firms surveyed for the index mentioned \"a muted domestic economy holding back production and sales\" due to high borrowing costs."

Payment cards issued by Mir have become more important since its U.S. rivals suspended operations in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and their payment cards which were issued in the country stopped working abroad. In February U.S. authorities imposed additional sweeping sanctions against Russia, including on its National Payment Card System (NSPK), which operates Mir cards. \"Starting April 3, 2024, adding and using Mir cards in Samsung Pay will not be available,\" Samsung Pay said in a statement on its website. \"At the same time, the functionality of adding and using club cards/loyalty cards in the Samsung Pay app will work unchanged.\" Samsung Pay said its services would continue to operate in Belarus, which has also come under heavy Western sanctions. The NSPK confirmed that the use of Mir cards in the Samsung Pay application would be suspended from April 3. \"The mobile payment service pre-installed on Samsung smartphones is suspending its partnership with the Mir payment system,\" the NSPK said, adding that the Mir Pay application can still be downloaded from the RuStore, a Russian app for Android users, and the Android App Gallery. Reuters verified that the Mir Pay app was not available on the Apple Store and Google Pay. \"In an attempt to complicate the lives of Russians, the Americans have synchronised with the Koreans,\" Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the Russian parliament's committee on information policy, wrote on the Telegram app on Wednesday."

        "content": "HANOI, March 26 (Reuters) - Vietnam's coal imports so far this year have nearly doubled from the same period of 2023, customs data shows, as the government strives to reassure foreign investors that factories will not face a repeat of last year's power shortages. The Southeast Asian nation, which hosts large manufacturing operations of multinational companies like South Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Taiwan's Foxconn (2354.TW) and Japan's Canon (7751.T), is facing increasing pressure after it could not guarantee continuous power supplies during a prolonged heatwave last summer. Some factories were forced to temporarily suspend production. During a meeting with foreign investors last week, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh vowed there will be no more electricity shortages, state media reported. Two foreign officials in attendance, who were not authorised to speak publicly, said Chinh's commitments were reassuring but vague on measures to achieve that goal. The prime minister's office did not respond to requests for comment. Vietnam's limited capacity to use renewable energy and commitments to avoiding new power cuts makes it \"imperative\" to import more coal, said Phan Xuan Dung, a researcher on Vietnam at the Singapore-based ISEAS think tank. Coal imports, mostly from Australia and Indonesia, were up by roughly 88% as of March 15 compared to the same period last year, customs data shows. In the first two months of the year output also rose 3.3% from domestic mines, which usually cover about half of Vietnam's demand, according to official estimates. That comes after Vietnam's 61% increase in imports of the inexpensive fuel last year as coal-fired power plants resumed full production, in line with rising use by Indonesia, Malaysia and other regional peers. Coal imports are projected to rise further in the second half of the year, a Vietnam-based trader said, when steelmakers and other energy-intensive industries are expected to boost production. No breakdown on power generation is yet available for this year, but on Monday coal-fired plants accounted for about 60% of total output, according to Vietnam's power network operator. The combination of imports and domestic output shows coal supply exceeded 8 million metric tons per month in the usually quieter January-February period, nearly 9% higher than the monthly average over the last two years. Vietnam, which is among the world's top 20 coal users by volume, wants to cut its reliance on the fuel but still expects peak use will not be reached this decade. As plans to boost renewable energy and gas face delays, the government wants to complete by June a transmission line to transfer electricity from the country's centre to its industrialised north. That is where heat-induced blackouts occurred last year and the El Nino weather pattern raises the risk of them this year. The government is also working on new rules to allow factories to directly purchase power from producers. Foreign investors, on which Vietnam's economy is highly reliant, are demanding quick action. Semiconductor companies are delaying investment decisions because of power supply risks, the South Korean chamber of commerce in Vietnam said in a paper published last week. In a separate paper last week, the American Chamber of Commerce asked the Vietnamese government to ease approval of energy projects to meet increasing power demand. Otherwise, attracting high-tech manufacturing and other key goals \"will be difficult to reach,\" the U.S. business group said."

        "content": "March 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Apple (AAPL.O) draws on the watershed 1998 case that broke Microsoft's stranglehold on desktop software, but that may prove to be an imperfect blueprint for addressing smartphone competition. The market for the iPhone today looks very different from the near-monopoly enjoyed by Microsoft's (MSFT.O) Windows operating system two decades ago, and the government as a result may face a tougher time in taking on Apple, legal experts said. The Department of Justice, along with 15 state governments, accused Apple of unlawfully monopolizing the smartphone market through restrictions on app developers that curb choice and innovation, which it said forces consumers to pay higher prices. Apple said the government is wrong on the facts and law. The government has to prove that Apple\u2019s business practices were \u201cexclusionary\u201d and harmed consumers by degrading the quality of rival products, according to several legal experts. The government accused Apple of suppressing technologies that would have increased competition among smartphones in five areas: so-called \"super apps,\" cloud streamed gaming apps, messaging apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. One example the government gave is familiar to anyone who texts from an iPhone to a user of an Android phone \u2014 the dreaded \"green bubble\" that results in hindrances such as grainy photos sent by text that don't apply when texting between two phones using Apple's iOS operating system. Antitrust enforcers said Apple was rapidly expanding its influence and power in industries including content creation and financial services. By comparison, Microsoft was accused of abusing its market dominance to impede users from freely installing software on computers using the company\u2019s operating system. That might sound similar to Apple's control over the app store, but legal experts said there are important differences. Apple can contract with whom it wants and design products as it sees fit, legal experts said. It becomes a problem when a company with monopoly power takes steps to lessen short-term profit in order to keep rivals out in the longer term, said Douglas Ross, an antitrust scholar at University of Washington\u2019s law school. \u201cThe fundamental assumption DOJ seems to have is that Apple must cooperate with its rivals to allow rivals to compete with Apple,\" Ross said. \"That has antitrust law backwards.\" Microsoft was forced to open its operating system because it controlled 95% of desktop operating systems in the 1990s. By comparison, Apple had 55% of the North American market for smartphones at the end of September based on shipments, with the rest largely made up of phones using Google's Android operating system, according to Canalys, a market analysis firm. The Justice Department seeks to define the market as that of smartphones in the United States. Apple representatives said they will try to persuade the court to define the market as the global smartphone market. Apple and rival Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) each had about a 20% market share globally in 2023, though Apple beat Samsung slightly on shipments, Canalys data showed. Microsoft \"clearly was a monopolist and there were no effective competitors in the PC operating system space,\" Ross said. On the other hand, Android \u201cis very popular, especially in the rest of the world, and is a very effective competitor with iOS.\u201d Ross predicted it would be harder for the Justice Department to prevail against Apple than it was in the Microsoft case. Some of these allegations have been touched upon before in court. In 2021, in an antitrust case brought by \"Fortnite\" creator Epic Games, a federal judge found after a trial that Epic failed to prove that Apple users were \"locked-in\" to their iPhones and would not switch to Android devices. Of course, government attorneys know these differences and still brought the case. Legal experts said that reflects the viewpoint within the DOJ and the Biden Administration's Federal Trade Commission about challenging cases. \u201cThey are happy to take on the risk of a really big case,\u201d said plaintiffs' lawyer Patrick McGahan, whose firm is involved in litigation against Apple. Litigator Melissa Maxman in Washington said the Microsoft case changed the tech landscape and lauded the government's lawsuit as a step toward greater competition in the smartphone market. \"If you open up the market for other competitors to get in you will see prices go down and quality go up,\" Maxman said. \"That's exactly what was said in Microsoft \u2014 and guess what, it was true.\" (This story has been refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 11)"

        "content": "HANOI, March 22 (Reuters) - Communist-ruled Vietnam is seeking its third president in little more than a year after the resignation of Vo Van Thuong, who was only elected last year after the sudden dismissal of his predecessor. With accumulated foreign direct investment higher than its gross domestic product, Vietnam's stability is crucial to multinationals with large operations in the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub, including Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)  , which ships from Vietnam half of its smartphones, and Apple (AAPL.O)  , which has many key suppliers in the country. That stability, which has been guaranteed for decades by a state tightly controlled by the Communist Party, now looks less certain, analysts say, although they agree the current leadership changes will not impact the country's key policies, including its \"bamboo diplomacy\" aimed at keeping good relations with the United States and China at the same time. The government statement did not elaborate on Thuong's shortcomings, but major leadership changes in the one-party state have recently been linked to the wide-ranging \"blazing furnace\" anti-bribery campaign, launched in 2016 by party chief Nguyen Phu Trong. It aims to eradicate corruption so widespread that in some provinces up to 90% of applicants for land certificates paid a bribe, according to a report published in March 2023 by the U.N. Development Programme and other organisations. The campaign intensified over the last two years, with critics saying it has been increasingly used for political purposes by party factions competing for power. Vietnam's foreign ministry on Friday denied that decisions under the anti-graft drive were politically motivated. Thuong, 53, stands accused of having violated party rules, according to a Communist Party statement issued on Wednesday, which did not clarify what exactly he did wrong. He quit days after police announced the arrest for alleged corruption a decade ago of a former head of central Vietnam's Quang Ngai province, who served while Thuong was party chief there. Vietnam's parliament accepted Thuong's resignation on Thursday, confirming a Reuters report from Sunday. It named Vice President Vo Thi Anh Xuan as acting president until the party decides the next candidate. Xuan also stepped in last year to temporarily replace the suddenly dismissed former president, Nguyen Xuan Phuc. At that time it took the party a month and a half to pick Thuong, who at the time of his election had been widely seen as a close ally to the party chief Trong. Leading candidates for the permanent position include the powerful minister of public security, To Lam, and party veteran Truong Thi Mai, according to multiple analysts. However, the former may be interested in the far more powerful position of party chief, a role that is up for grabs in 2026 when Trong's third mandate ends, but that the ageing leader may make available earlier, officials and analysts say. Mai's job as permanent member of the secretariat of the party's central committee had been seen at risk amid the latest leadership reshuffle, according to analysts, officials and diplomats, but no decision was announced about her on Wednesday."

        "content": "SANTA CLARA, California, March 20 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O)   is planning a $100-billion spending spree across four U.S. states to build and expand factories after securing $19.5 billion in federal grants and loans - and hopes to secure another $25 billion in tax breaks. The centerpiece of Intel's five-year spending plan is turning empty fields near Columbus, Ohio, into what CEO Pat Gelsinger described to reporters on Tuesday as \"the largest AI chip manufacturing site in the world\", starting as soon as 2027. The U.S. government announced the federal funds to Intel under the CHIPS Act on Wednesday. Intel's plan will also involve revamping sites in New Mexico and Oregon and expanding operations in Arizona, where longtime rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW)   is also building a massive factory that it hopes will receive funding from President Joe Biden's push to bring advanced semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States. The funds provided by Biden's plan for a broader chipmaking renaissance will go a long way to help Intel mend its wounded business model. For decades, the firm led the world in making the fastest and smallest semiconductors, selling them at a premium price and plowing the profits back into more research and development to stay ahead of the pack. But Intel lost that manufacturing edge in the 2010s to TSMC and its profit margins plummeted as it cut prices to keep market share with inferior products. Gelsinger announced a plan in 2021 to return Intel to the No. 1 position, but he has said he will need government support to make the plan profitable. With that assistance in hand, it is now time for Intel to spend. Gelsinger said about 30% of the $100-billion plan will be spent on construction costs such as labor, piping and concrete. The remaining will go towards buying chipmaking tools from firms such as ASML (ASML.AS)  , Tokyo Electron (8035.T)  , Applied Materials (AMAT.O)   and KLA (KLAC.O)  , among others. Those tools will help bring the Ohio site online by 2027 or 2028, though Gelsinger warned the timeline could slip if the chip market takes a dive. Beyond grants and loans, Intel plans to make most of the purchases from its existing cash flows. \"It will still take three to five years for Intel to become a serious player in the foundry market\" for cutting-edge chips, said Kinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights. However, he warned more investment would be needed before Intel could overtake TSMC, adding that the Taiwanese firm could remain the leader for \"some time to come\". Gelsinger has previously said a second round of U.S. funding for chip factories would likely be needed to re-establish the U.S. as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, which he reiterated on Tuesday. \"It took us three-plus decades to lose this industry. It's not going to come back in three to five years of CHIPS Act\" funding, said Gelsinger, who referred to the low-interest-rate funding as \"smart capital\". But even with the federal backing, Intel needs to show that it can compete with its Taiwanese and Korean rivals sooner rather than later, said Ben Bajarin, CEO of analyst firm Creative Strategies. \"It will be important to know how much longer 'smart capital' is needed for Intel before they can stand on their own,\" Bajarin said. Overall, though, Intel would be the most important chipmaker for U.S. interests, even as rivals build in the country, said Jimmy Goodrich, semiconductor export and technology adviser to the RAND Corp. \"Only Intel has the workforce, technology, and supply chain that is largely U.S.-centric. So, while what TSMC and Samsung are doing here is important and should be welcomed, it's also important to have a strong home team,\" he said."

Biden announced the preliminary agreement for $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans for Intel in Arizona, where some of the funding will be used to build two new factories and modernize an existing one. He said the pandemic helped cause an acute shortage of semiconductors, forcing factories to shut and prices to rise, and he has since been determined to invest in America. \"We will enable advanced semiconductor manufacturing to make a comeback here in America after 40 years,\" the president said. Biden, a Democrat, also attacked Donald Trump and said under the Republican former president's policies, companies sent jobs overseas and Trump's tax cuts helped wealthy corporations. \"If we invented it in America, it should be made in America,\" Biden said. This investment \"will transform the country in a way, you don't even understand.\" Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo on Tuesday called it one of the largest investments ever in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. She said the administration hopes to increase the U.S. share of advanced chip production from 0% to 20% by 2030 through the subsidy program. The historic outlay shows the Biden administration is betting big on Intel as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, a bid to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in funding. It could also help Biden, who lags Trump in voter perceptions of their ability to manage the U.S. economy, to again take Arizona in November's presidential election. The Democrat narrowly won the Southwestern swing state in 2020. The CHIPS Act's goal is to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan, as the share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the U.S. has fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Lawmakers have warned U.S. dependence on chips manufactured in Taiwan by the world's top contract chip manufacturer TSMC is risky because China claims the island as its territory and has reserved the right to use force to retake it. Republican U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, a sponsor of legislation that helped shape the CHIPS Act, welcomed Wednesday's announcement. Biden's Arizona trip could also help Democrats defend a critical U.S. Senate seat in November and possibly provide a boost in a pair of competitive House of Representatives races. Arizona was a point of pride for Biden's 2020 campaign, which flipped the state   for the first time in six presidential elections, but his aides see delivering a repeat victory as a tall order. Recent polls show Biden trailing Trump by single digits in the state, according to the website FiveThirtyEight. It is also welcome news for Intel, which in January forecast first-quarter revenue could miss market estimates by more than $2 billion, as it grapples with uncertain demand for its chips used in the traditional server and personal computer markets. Intel shares ended the day up just 0.36% at $42.20. In addition to Intel's Arizona projects, the money will help fund company projects in Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The chip maker is also expected to receive as much as $3.5 billion from the Commerce Department to boost security at its Arizona facilities to produce sensitive chips for the military. The Intel award is the latest in a string of subsidy announcements. Awards for South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC are expected in the coming weeks. The Commerce Department is dedicating $28 billion for government subsidies for advanced chips manufacturing - although it has more than $70 billion in requests - and also has $75 billion in lending authority."

        "content": "NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - UK hedge fund Palliser Capital is expanding into the U.S. and said on Wednesday it hired Steve Kasoff, bringing on board a former Elliott Investment Management partner to evaluate current and new opportunities in the United States. At Palliser, Kasoff will reunite with James Smith who ran Elliott's Hong Kong operations before founding his London-headquartered firm in 2021. Kasoff, a former equity partner and senior portfolio manager at Elliott, will be Palliser's first employee in the U.S. and joins 17 others who are based in London and Asia. Before retiring from Elliott in 2020, Kasoff headed the firm's investments in real estate and structured credit. Smith praised Kasoff's depth of experience and success across asset classes and said he will benefit Palliser's entire portfolio, including with current and new ideas. Palliser has pushed for changes at Japan's Keisei Electric Railway (9009.T)   and U.K. oil and gas exploration and development company Capricorn Energy (CNE.L)  . It is also urging Samsung C&T (028260.KS)   to spend its cash better, improve governance and communications and simplify its corporate structure. The fund, which oversees roughly $850 million in assets, returned more than 10% after fees in the last 12 months, people familiar with the performance said. The average multi-strategy fund returned 8.56% in 2023, Hedge Fund Research data show."

        "content": "SEOUL, March 20 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)   expects $100 million or more of revenue from its next batch of advanced chip-packaging products this year, co-CEO Kye-Hyun Kyung said on Wednesday. Samsung set up advanced chip packaging as a business unit last year, and Kyung said he expects the results of Samsung's investment to come out in earnest from the second half of this year. Kyung's remarks were made during Samsung's annual general shareholders' meeting. Samsung's memory chip business seeks to achieve a greater profit share than its market share this year, Kyung said. Samsung's market share in DRAM chips, used in tech devices, reached 45.5% in the fourth quarter last year, according to data provider TrendForce. To do this, Samsung seeks to secure a competitive advantage in high-end memory chips required by booming artificial intelligence demand, including mass producing a 12-stack version of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips called HBM3E. For a future generation of HBM chips called HBM4, likely to be released in 2025 with more customised designs, Samsung will take advantage of having memory chips, chip contract manufacturing and chip design businesses under one roof to satisfy customer needs, Kyung said. Answering a shareholder question on Samsung's recent setback in the current HBM market compared to rival SK Hynix (000660.KS), Kyung said: \"We're better prepared to prevent that from happening again in the future\". Samsung Electronics shares rose as much as 6.04% on Wednesday, and are set for their highest one-day jump since early September after Nvidia (NVDA.O) CEO Jensen Huang said the AI semiconductor leader is qualifying Samsung's HBM chips for use. Samsung expects tangible results soon from other memory products being developed for use in AI, including compute express link (CXL) and processing-in-memory (PIM) products, Kyung added."
